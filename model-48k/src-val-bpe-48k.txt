Conver@@ sel@@ y, the campaign leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (B@@ Z@@ Ö@@ ), Car@@ in@@ thi@@ an Governor J@@ örg Haid@@ er, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics. 
According to the preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SP@@ Ö@@ ) remains the strong@@ est in the country with 29.@@ 8 percent of votes, however, it has lost 5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006. 
Ö@@ V@@ P, which with its 25.@@ 6 percent los@@ es nearly nine percent of votes, fa@@ red even worse. 
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-@@ war history, and particularly for the Peop@@ le's Party, who urged the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result. 
At the beginning of Jul@@ y, when Ö@@ V@@ P left the co@@ ali@@ tion, the Peop@@ le's Party still had a significant lead on SP@@ Ö in the poll@@ s. 
V@@ o@@ ters, however, apparently punished them for le@@ tting the government fl@@ oun@@ der. 
In the first reactions to the results, there were already specul@@ ations about the possible resign@@ ation of the party head and current vice-@@ ch@@ ancell@@ or Wil@@ hel@@ m Mol@@ te@@ rer. 
Ob@@ ser@@ vers anticipate that this could take place as early as at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership on Mon@@ day. 
Such a development would certainly simplif@@ y the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results, that is, the renewal of the large coalition of SP@@ Ö and Ö@@ V@@ P. 
Given the strengthening of both right-@@ wing populist parties - the Freed@@ om Party (F@@ P@@ Ö@@ ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and B@@ Z@@ Ö eleven percent of the votes - however, at the same time, the Social Democ@@ rats expressed fear of a repetition of the year 1999, when the Peop@@ le's Party agreed with the popul@@ ists (F@@ P@@ Ö was still united at that time, it broke away from B@@ Z@@ Ö in 200@@ 5) on a common government, which eventually provoked sanctions from the European Union. 
Haid@@ er, who has already announced that he is prepared to work together with any party and pre@@ sumes he will return to Vienna to national politics, is evidently banking on this development. 
The Green Party also got into the parliam@@ ent, but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties. 
Evid@@ ently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliam@@ ent. 
Schwar@@ z@@ en@@ b@@ erg@@ : Rel@@ ations with India could worsen 
According to Foreign Minister Karel Schwar@@ z@@ en@@ b@@ erg, if it will not be possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists charged in India with the illegal collection of be@@ et@@ les, a certain worsening of Czech@@ -@@ Indian relations could take place. 
The minister made this statement in New York following today's meeting with his Indian counter@@ part, P@@ ran@@ ab M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e. 
"@@ If it is not solv@@ ed, then yes, then a certain worsening would take place@@ ," he states following the meeting initiated from the Czech side. 
Following the negotiations, M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e said that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial matters. 
Nevertheless, he said that in the case of Pet@@ r Š@@ v@@ á@@ cha@@ , who was cleared of the charges and pen@@ alized with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dar@@ je@@ el@@ ing, under the jurisdiction of which the matter belong@@ s. 
"@@ His problem could be solv@@ ed@@ ," the minister said. 
According to M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e, it would be best for Em@@ il Ku@@ č@@ era, sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to higher authorities. 
He can then request to be released on bail and wait for the verdict outside of jail@@ , he explained. 
Schwar@@ z@@ en@@ berg confirmed that his partner had also said this during the negotiations. 
"@@ He recommends appealing to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him@@ ," the head of Czech diplom@@ acy said. 
The only way the Czech side can become involved in the whole matter is to provide the sentenced individuals with "@@ competent legal support@@ ", the Indian minister said. 
At the same time, he said that the Indian side is already also providing them with aid of this type. 
"@@ It is in our greatest interest to maintain the best relations with Indi@@ a, which have a long-@@ standing tradi@@ tion. 
The Indi@@ ans also acknowledge this@@ ," Schwar@@ z@@ en@@ berg said. 
At the same time, as he told the Czech Press agency, he emphas@@ ized in front of his partner that the Czech Republic placed great importance on the problem of the Czech ent@@ om@@ olog@@ ists. 
"@@ We truly consider the arrest and charging of these Czech scientists to be a grave mistak@@ e@@ ," he decl@@ ared. 
The minister avoided answ@@ ering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to pursue the matter. 
He stated merely "@@ I have already received quite a few promis@@ es@@ ". 
Czech refe@@ re@@ es battle for ocean floor 
He steps toward the electronic wall map depic@@ ting Austr@@ alia and the surrounding sea areas. 
However, he is not interested in the contin@@ ent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean. 
"@@ This is@@ land, and with it the ocean floor surrounding it, belongs to Australia. 
At the same time, the area is as large as the continent itsel@@ f@@ ," says Italian lawyer Luigi San@@ to@@ su@@ os@@ so, who belongs to the thirty-@@ member team of employees of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. 
His bos@@ s, the division director@@ , Czech lawyer V@@ á@@ cla@@ v Mik@@ ul@@ ka, follows what he is saying and occasionally adds something. 
Z@@ est and enthusiasm for work are dominant here. 
The ocean floor shel@@ ters a thus far little known world rich in natural resources. 
It is possible to find oil, ore@@ s, and other minerals, but also thus far unknown living organisms that hold the ke@@ y, for example, to the development of a cure for cancer. 
A floor larger than the continent 
Co@@ ast@@ al countries today have begun to ve@@ hem@@ ently compete for the new under@@ water territory. 
That is, according to a UN agreement they are utili@@ zing the rights on which they agreed in 1982 in Mon@@ te@@ go Ba@@ y, Jam@@ a@@ ic@@ a. 
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilome@@ ters from the coast of the given country. 
According to the agreement, that country has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shel@@ f. 
"@@ Taken simply, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the ocean floor which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea and its substr@@ at@@ um. 
It reached beyond the edge of the coastal sea, often even beyond the edge of the two hundred nau@@ tical miles of the so-called exclusive economic z@@ one@@ ", Mik@@ ul@@ ka explain@@ s. 
The request the given country sub@@ mits to the Commission on the Lim@@ its of the Con@@ tin@@ ental Shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements. 
It is the result of many years of preparatory work. 
"@@ One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and speci@@ alized technical assistance. 
The commission has thus far discussed five request@@ s, from Russia, Braz@@ il, Australia, Ireland and New Zeal@@ and. 
Only the last three of those countries have been successful so far@@ ," Mik@@ ul@@ ka add@@ s. 
Recently the success of Australia, which was the first to expand its under@@ water dom@@ ain, was registered worldwide. 
But New Zealand gained as well - the area of the ocean floor that the commission conceded to it is around 1.6 million square kilome@@ ters, that is, roughly six times bigger than the size of the country itself. 
Both countries invest@@ ed millions of dollars into surve@@ ying. 
The profit which will ensu@@ e from the utili@@ zation of the ocean floor in the future will be, they hop@@ e, pric@@ eless. 
Other countries will also gradually submit their requests. 
They have until ten years from the moment when they ratified the "@@ Mon@@ te@@ go Bay Agre@@ ement@@ " to do so. 
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the agreement as the "@@ common heritage of human@@ kind@@ " begin@@ s. 
Here no country has any exclusive position any longer. 
Min@@ ing rights in this area are granted through the agreement established by the international institution. 
"@@ But the ocean floor is no K@@ lon@@ di@@ ke@@ ", director Mik@@ ul@@ ka says exagger@@ atedly, adding that his "@@ individual areas are legally clearly del@@ im@@ ited and their regime is an@@ cho@@ red in contract@@ s.@@ " 
Czech@@ s in the Pacific 
Part of the ocean floor currently belongs to the Czech Republic. 
It shares it with other countries from the former Eastern Blo@@ c as a part of the common organization "@@ Inter@@ oce@@ an@@ metal@@ ". 
By agreement, this organization, like the invest@@ ors of several small other countries, gained the status of so-called "@@ pione@@ ering investor@@ " in 1991. 
It is authorized to mine in the C@@ lar@@ ion@@ C@@ lip@@ per@@ ton zone in the Pacific Oce@@ an, which lies between Mexic@@ o, H@@ awa@@ i@@ i and Ki@@ rib@@ ati@@ . 
The area investigated by the invest@@ or is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovak@@ ia. 
The ocean floor there is ru@@ gg@@ ed, it is a sort of under@@ water model of the Tat@@ ra M@@ oun@@ tain@@ s. 
"@@ It is possible to mine there on an overall area of 75@@ ,000 square kilome@@ ters. 
The area is a rich local@@ ity for the collection of pol@@ y-@@ metal concre@@ tions containing nickel, cop@@ per, cobal@@ t and mang@@ anes@@ e@@ ," says another lawyer, Pak@@ sh@@ i Ra@@ jan from India. 
The Maced@@ on@@ ian lawyer from the division, Rob@@ er San@@ dev@@ , brings one such concre@@ tion to demonstr@@ ate. 
It looks like a small pot@@ ato or, with a bit of fantas@@ y, the my@@ thical sh@@ em, which, according to leg@@ end, brought the G@@ ole@@ m to life. 
German Special For@@ c@@ es Present at Ho@@ stage Res@@ c@@ ue 
In solving the ho@@ stage crisis, the Egyp@@ tian government had requested help from Germany - which sent in the experts. 
When push came to sh@@ ov@@ e, the special forces were read@@ y, but their services were not required in the end. 
More and more details are surfac@@ ing on the circumstances surrounding the liberation of the eleven European tourists abducted in Egyp@@ t. 
According to the German Federal Minist@@ ries of Def@@ en@@ se and of the Inter@@ i@@ or, German special forces indirectly took part in the rescue mission. 
Speci@@ alists of the Federal Ar@@ med For@@ c@@ es (B@@ undes@@ we@@ hr@@ ) and members of the German Federal Police (B@@ pol@@ ) and its GS@@ G 9 and Air Gu@@ ard special units were present at the rescu@@ e, spok@@ es@@ men of the ministri@@ es said Monday night, as well as members of the Federal C@@ rim@@ inal Police Office (B@@ K@@ A) and logis@@ tics experts of the Agency of Technical Rel@@ ief (@@ TH@@ W@@ ). 
The German forces were not required, however, they said, because the cap@@ tors abandoned their hostages and fl@@ ed when they became aware that the hostages were about to be freed by force. 
The Egyp@@ tian government had accepted the help offered by Germany to rely on the German forces as back@@ up during the operation. 
`@@ Luc@@ kil@@ y, it did@@ n't come to that@@ ,' a spok@@ es@@ man of the German Federal Ministry of the Inter@@ ior said. 
The travel group consisting of five Germans, five Itali@@ ans, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyp@@ tian compan@@ ions had been am@@ bus@@ hed and abducted on September 19 in the south of Egyp@@ t. 
After their abduction in a desert region in the south of Egyp@@ t, the hostages had been carried back and forth in the border region between Egyp@@ t, Lib@@ ya, Sudan and Cha@@ d. 
To date, the identity of the cap@@ tors remains unknown, as do details on the rescue or on possible ran@@ som@@ s. 
The former hostages have arrived safely and sound@@ ly in Ca@@ iro, mean@@ while. 
German Foreign Minister Ste@@ in@@ me@@ ier said they have been ent@@ rusted to the care of the German emb@@ ass@@ y. 
He did not comment on the details of the rescu@@ e. 
In Berlin, no immediate information on their return to Germany was given. 
According to German newspaper `@@ B@@ ild@@ ,' the five tourists and the special forces are to board an Airbus of the German Air For@@ c@@ e, which is said to arrive in Germany on Tues@@ day. 
U@@ .@@ S. House of Representatives Re@@ jec@@ ts B@@ ail@@ out 
The 700 billion dollar bail@@ out package for the financial markets narrow@@ ly failed to pass in the first of the two chambers of the U@@ .@@ S. Congres@@ s. 
The Do@@ w Jones took a nose@@ -@@ di@@ ve. 
With a vote of 227 to 206 again@@ st, the U@@ .@@ S. House of Representatives rejected the government@@ 's bail@@ out package for the financial markets. 
All appe@@ als by President George W@@ . B@@ ush and leading officials of both parties not@@ with@@ standing, no majority was reached for the program that was meant to contain the chaos at the financial markets. 
In a dramatic campaign@@ , supporters had made desperate attempts to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar plan@@ 's mer@@ its. 
Bar@@ ney Fran@@ k, one of the main Democratic negoti@@ ators, had called on representatives for approval, even though it was an un@@ popular plan. 
`@@ It's hard to get political approval for the prevention of something that hasn't happened yet@@ ,' he conce@@ ded. 
While the vote was still under@@ way, the Do@@ w Jones saw a drop of more than six percent@@ , or 600 points. 
It was caused by investor@@ s' worries that the government bail@@ out might fail. 
It recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to take another nose@@ -@@ di@@ ve when the rejection was made public. 
Experts now expect further heavy turbul@@ ences in the international financial markets. 
For the plan to be implemented, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Sen@@ ate is required. 
Tra@@ vel Ag@@ encies Report Increase in Bo@@ ok@@ ings 
It's going to be a good winter for German travel agencies, evid@@ ent@@ ly: 
A survey says that the turno@@ ver of book@@ ings for the coming months has increased significantly versus the previous year - for the winter season by as much as 30 percent@@ , ev@@ en. 
Despite prospects of a weak economy, the German@@ s' appetite for travelling remains un@@ spo@@ il@@ ed, a survey says. 
For book@@ ings during the winter seas@@ on, travel agencies saw an increase in turno@@ ver of 31 percent versus the same period of the previous year, the German Tra@@ vel Association (D@@ R@@ V) reported in Berlin on Mon@@ day. 
According to market research firm G@@ f@@ K, there has been an increase in book@@ ings during the autumn months as well. 
Tra@@ vel agencies had seen an increase in turno@@ ver of approximately eleven percent for October versus 2007, the DR@@ V said. 
The results are based on the figures of G@@ f@@ K, which processes the bo@@ oking data of 1200 German travel agencies every month and uses them to make projec@@ tions for the market as a whole. 
In@@ cluded are travel book@@ ings made through August 2008. 
Due to a weak dol@@ l@@ ar, especially tri@@ ps to the United States were in demand, the DR@@ V said. 
In this area, book@@ ings had increased by approximately one thir@@ d, it said. 
That as@@ ide, it pointed out Spain, Turkey and Greece as being popular among Germans, as well as domestic regions. 
All@@ -@@ inclus@@ ive tri@@ ps were especially sough@@ t-@@ after, DR@@ V President Kla@@ us La@@ ep@@ ple said. 
In the light of increasing energy and food prices, their cost was `@@ more calcul@@ able for clients than that of individually organ@@ ized vac@@ ation@@ s@@ ,' said La@@ ep@@ ple. 
Consum@@ ers could save money through early-@@ bird or all-@@ inclus@@ ive dis@@ counts, among others, La@@ ep@@ ple said. 
Because the summer months had been very well-@@ book@@ ed, as well, there would be another increase in turno@@ ver versus the previous year, he said - although another survey reports that the number of travelling German@@ s sank compared to the previous year.

But there is one thing that connec@@ ts us: We@@ '@@ ve been at the W@@ ies@@ n for barely three minutes, and already the photograph@@ ers are crow@@ ding around us and snap@@ shooting away, filling up their memory cards - very flat@@ tering, and it's my first visit to the W@@ ies@@ n, to boot@@ . 
This is how you make friends. 
The che@@ apo D@@ ir@@ n@@ dl seems to be doing its job. 
For a W@@ ies@@ n tourist usually based north of the `@@ We@@ is@@ sw@@ ur@@ st equ@@ ator@@ ,' that com@@ fy feeling wearing traditional Bav@@ arian gar@@ b had left much to be desired to date.

Turkey's widening diplomatic horiz@@ ons 
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were eag@@ er to penetrate deep into Turkey's hinter@@ land. 
On the eastern side of the B@@ osph@@ or@@ us, maybe just 20 steps into Asia, stands one of the fin@@ est rel@@ ics of this failed imperi@@ al ambition. 
Hy@@ dar@@ p@@ ash@@ a railway station was designed by two German architec@@ ts Ot@@ to Rit@@ ter and Helmut Con@@ u in the neo-@@ ren@@ a@@ iss@@ ance style. 
That at least is what the gu@@ ide@@ books tell you. 
The building sits ast@@ ride the end of the platforms with a to@@ wer at each of its front cor@@ ners looking for all the world like some provincial German town h@@ all. 
The stone is dir@@ ty. 
The whole edi@@ fice slightly dec@@ ay@@ ing. 
But once inside the va@@ ul@@ ted ticket office, there is no doub@@ ting the gran@@ de@@ ur of the enterprise of which this was the we@@ ster@@ n@@ most gate@@ way. 
The station was opened in August 19@@ 08 by a German consor@@ tium, the Anat@@ ol@@ ia@@ -B@@ agh@@ da@@ d Corpor@@ ation. 
Germany, a lat@@ ec@@ om@@ er to the imperi@@ al ga@@ me, intended to realise its ambi@@ tions to domin@@ ate the Middle East by means of this railway running to Damasc@@ us, Baghd@@ ad, and beyond into what today is Saudi Arab@@ ia. 
But German@@ y's imperi@@ al ambi@@ tions foun@@ dered during the World War I. 
Its railway tracks were attacked by Law@@ rence of Arab@@ ia and his Arab irregular@@ s. 
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, en@@ gen@@ dered by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, has gone 
British and domin@@ ion forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Sy@@ ria. 
And there was bad news for Hy@@ der@@ p@@ ash@@ a station too. 
In 19@@ 17 an am@@ mun@@ ition train ble@@ w up destroying its elabor@@ ate ro@@ of. 
Turkish sources say it was sabot@@ age. 
Since then it has slowly moul@@ dered away, largely by@@ passed by history. 
But today, this railway gateway to Anat@@ ol@@ ia and all points e@@ ast, serves - symbol@@ ically at least - to highlight Turkey's widening diplomatic horiz@@ ons. 
The governing Justice and Development party - the A@@ K@@ P - has craf@@ ted a whole new foreign policy for the country. 
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, en@@ gen@@ dered by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, has g@@ one. 
Now there is a new policy of eng@@ ag@@ ement. 
Rem@@ ark@@ ably the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Sy@@ ria, with the Palestinian fac@@ tions of Hamas and Fat@@ a@@ h, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States. 
To gau@@ ge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boar@@ ded the night sleep@@ er to the Turkish capital An@@ kar@@ a, to visit one of the A@@ K@@ P@@ 's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Su@@ at K@@ ini@@ k@@ li@@ og@@ lu@@ . 
The next morning - some ten and a half hours later - after a j@@ ol@@ ting ride along tracks that produced the old world cad@@ ences of the famous document@@ ary The Night M@@ ail@@ , I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a new sec@@ ular state int@@ ent on turning its back on the Ot@@ tom@@ an past. 
But the A@@ K@@ P with its well-known Islam@@ ist roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consen@@ sus@@ . 
It has prompted some suspicion in the West, most notably in Washing@@ ton. 
A taxi took me to the A@@ K@@ P@@ 's head@@ quarters, an ultra-@@ modern stone and steel structure - purpos@@ e-@@ built - in a developing sub@@ ur@@ b, surrounded by half-@@ constructed shopping centres and power-@@ pati@@ s@@ series where middle manag@@ ers in business suits - both men and women - met to make early morning de@@ als. 
Su@@ at K@@ ini@@ k@@ li@@ og@@ lu could have been a cent@@ re-@@ right politician from almost any other political party in Europe. 
Su@@ it, ti@@ e, I am sure he was even packing a Black@@ ber@@ ry. 
"@@ The aim of the par@@ ty@@ 's foreign policy is now to re-@@ integrate Turkey into its immediate neighbour@@ hood. 
The Cold War was an an@@ om@@ aly@@ ," he told me. 
Turkey had been cut off from its hinter@@ land. 
Today it had to look e@@ ast@@ wards and we@@ st@@ wards at the same time. 
It was not a case of one or the other. 
It had to do both. 
"@@ But surely at some point@@ ," I ask@@ ed, "@@ Turkey might be forced to cho@@ ose@@ ?" 
"@@ Turkey@@ ," he said, "@@ did not want to have to face that choic@@ e.@@ " 
He then stressed a point that almost everyone I have spoken to here has rec@@ ited almost by ro@@ te: Turkey's ties not just to the Middle East@@ , but to the Caucas@@ us, and around the Black Sea, are as much to the benefit of Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey. 
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can metaphor@@ ically ride those rail lines e@@ ast@@ wards towards Asia and the Middle E@@ ast. 
B@@ ack at Hy@@ dar@@ p@@ ash@@ a st@@ ation, after another largely sle@@ epl@@ ess night, I thought of those two German gentle@@ men Her@@ r Rit@@ ter and Her@@ r Con@@ u who had watched this edi@@ fice being built 100 years ago. 
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambi@@ tions may now, to a large part, be in Turkey's hands. 
And as I waited at the terminal for the ferry to take me back across the B@@ osph@@ or@@ us, I rec@@ alled that in those days Turkey had always been called "@@ the sick man of Europe@@ ." 
Then at least there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fasc@@ inating country. 
Liv@@ es remembe@@ red@@ : Ver@@ non Hand@@ ley and Wil@@ li@@ am Wo@@ odru@@ ff 
Mar@@ k Bro@@ wn writ@@ es: As Gu@@ ild@@ ford@@ 's mus@@ ical director from 19@@ 6@@ 2, Ver@@ non "@@ T@@ od@@ " Hand@@ ley (@@ ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary, S@@ ept 1@@ 1) had charge of the Gu@@ ild@@ ford Phil@@ harmon@@ ic Or@@ che@@ stra and Cho@@ ir. 
As part of his music scheme for the bo@@ rough@@ , in the next year he founded his wonderful youth cho@@ ir, Prote@@ us. 
It was supposed to be for under@@ -2@@ 1@@ s, but by the time the Prote@@ us san@@ g its fin@@ ale in 197@@ 9, several of us were in our late 20@@ s - we just refused to give the cho@@ ir up. 
The name "@@ Prote@@ us@@ " (the my@@ th@@ ological sha@@ pe-@@ chang@@ er) represented the cho@@ ir@@ 's willingness and ability to tackle whatever music was presented to it, whether mad@@ ri@@ gal or M@@ es@@ si@@ a@@ en, whether unaccompanied or with full or@@ che@@ str@@ a. 
The mus@@ ical ver@@ sati@@ l@@ ity produced by such a youth cho@@ ir was often aston@@ ish@@ ing, always excit@@ ing, and it was all due to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music which remained absolutely constant throughout the years. 
How often we were told by T@@ od to "@@ let the music speak for itsel@@ f@@ ". 
He@@ '@@ d say: "@@ The compos@@ er knows what he wants. 
It's all there in the music.

His bat@@ on technique was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictator@@ i@@ al, nor fl@@ or@@ id. 
Whatever the mus@@ ical standard, he always raised it even higher.

Over the past 40-@@ odd years, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concer@@ ts and I can honest@@ ly say that I have never been dis@@ appointed with a single one - and many times inspired by them. 
T@@ od Hand@@ ley had that rare combination of great@@ ness plus personal modest@@ y.

Sec@@ ond assaul@@ t for Hon@@ da@@ 's super-@@ selling 
N@@ ext November H@@ onda will launch the marketing of the second J@@ az@@ z model gener@@ ation. 
If the previous model was already characterized by high habit@@ ability, this new min@@ iv@@ an has an inter@@ ior wider space. 
In addition, it is equipped with a fine mechan@@ ics which increases the driving comfort and permits to save fuel. 
E@@ volution instead of revolu@@ tion. 
This is H@@ onda J@@ az@@ z@@ ' second gener@@ ation. 
While aes@@ the@@ tically the new J@@ az@@ z looks like the previous model, changes brought to the min@@ iv@@ an are numer@@ ous. 
Among others, it is worth pointing out its innovative design, new plat@@ form, bigger size and pretty new mechan@@ ics. 
Any@@ way, before moving on to analy@@ ze the new model, may be useful to point out that this new J@@ az@@ z comes only six years after the entry of the first gener@@ ation. 
Therefore, a first observation should consider that H@@ onda has renewed this model more quickly than the other companies usually do. 
Even if the J@@ az@@ z model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a phenomenon in terms of sal@@ es. 
This is the case of Japan, where J@@ az@@ z was the be@@ st-@@ selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008. 
Just there, almost a million units of J@@ az@@ z were sold from the model@@ 's laun@@ ch. 
The second market was the Old Con@@ tin@@ ent, with about half a million units sold in six years. 
Despite these numbers, H@@ onda believes this new J@@ az@@ z will increase even more its sales in the seg@@ ment. 
So, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83@@ ,000 units of this model, in 2009 it estimates it will be around 100,000 cars. This fore@@ see a possible increase in sales of 17% just in the European market. 
Regarding the Spanish market, H@@ onda has sold a total of 8,000 units of J@@ az@@ z since 2002, corresponding to 6.@@ 7% of total sales for the company in Spain. 
With the new gener@@ ation's com@@ ing, the responsible for the company in Spain expect to sell around 2.@@ 000 units of J@@ az@@ z within one year. 
The arrival of the new H@@ onda J@@ az@@ z will probably make it possible, by reducing the lowering of sales in Spain to a large extent. 
In fact, the persons in charge for the brand expect to get to the end of the year with a total of 22@@ ,000 units sold, that is 4.@@ 000 units less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%. 
Despite the increase in sal@@ es, H@@ onda has also incre@@ mented its market share in Spain, reaching the 1.@@ 8%, compared to the last year 1.@@ 6%. 
At the same time, the Japanese company expects to reach the 2% in 2010. 
To achieve this, H@@ onda is confid@@ ent in another new model of its. 
This is In@@ sight, a hybrid five-@@ door compact car, 4.@@ 37 meters in length. The Japanese company hopes to sell about 200@@ ,000 units of this model worldwide, within one year. 
According to the markets and Japanese manufacturer@@ s' estimates, the 50% of In@@ sigh@@ t's sale will come from the United States, while the remaining 50% will be from both the Old Con@@ tinent and Japan. 
The commercial launch of In@@ sight is planned for the early next year, shortly after the presentation of the model inside the company in January in Val@@ enz@@ a. 
Compared to the first gener@@ ation, the new J@@ az@@ z has grown in all its enti@@ ret@@ y. 
It reaches now 3,@@ 90 meters length (@@ five centi@@ metres more@@ ), 1,@@ 69 meters width (two centi@@ metres more) and its inter@@ ax@@ le 2,@@ 50 me@@ ters, with an incre@@ ment of five centi@@ metre@@ s. 
Its 1,@@ 52 meters he@@ ight, still, remained unchanged. 
Together with the size, its hab@@ itable inter@@ ior increased in space. 
This advantage stem@@ s, first of all from the new plat@@ form, and second from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central location, a solution already adopted in the previous J@@ az@@ z. 
Moreover, the trun@@ k's capacity - a double bottom volume - rises to 39@@ 9 lit@@ res, a 19 litres bigger capacity respect to the first gener@@ ation. 
To be noted, these is the H@@ onda J@@ az@@ z 1.@@ 4@@ 's measures, while the trun@@ k's capacity in model 1.2 is just 37@@ 9 litres. 
Other improvements - in addition to external el@@ ements, such as the rear led or the possibility to m@@ ount the pan@@ or@@ amic glass - concern the improved access to back seat@@ s. 
Do@@ ors which allow access to back seats, open now with an angle of 80 degre@@ es, compared to 67 degrees in the first model. 
In addition, all engines are pretty new in this second generation of cars. 
At the time of market@@ ing, this small model will come with a petrol engines of 1.2 or 1.4 litres. 
Both mechanical systems will include the i-@@ VTE@@ C technology which permits a lower fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optim@@ izes the mechanical refin@@ ements and, at the same time, maintains high tor@@ que engine in all its phas@@ es. 
The 1.2 litre version reaches a power of 90 h@@ p at 6000 rp@@ m with a maximum tor@@ que of 114 N@@ m. at 4@@ 900 rp@@ m. 
The pro@@ pulsion - which in previous J@@ az@@ z reached the 78 h@@ p – just needs 5.@@ 3 litres of fuel and produces around 125 grams of CO2 emissions equival@@ ent. 
Compared to the previous pro@@ pul@@ sion, which in the first-@@ generation model used 83 h@@ p, the new one can take advantage of 100 h@@ p. 
The 1.4 J@@ az@@ z with 100 h@@ p reaches a combination of 5.@@ 4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 em@@ it@@ ted. 
A '@@ be@@ e-@@ car@@ ' to avoid coll@@ isions 
In developing the technologies for the prevention of accidents, N@@ iss@@ an got inspired this time, by nature, and especially by bees. 
The Japanese company has created a ro@@ bo@@ t that, imit@@ ating the flight of bees, can avoid accidents. 
This is the Bi@@ o-@@ mime@@ tic C@@ ar Rob@@ ot D@@ ri@@ ve, or BR@@ 23@@ C, the first step to project technologies for the prevention of coll@@ is@@ ions. 
The engine@@ ers of the Advanced Technical Centre of N@@ iss@@ an Motor Co. have developed this little ro@@ bo@@ t in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technology of the prestigious University of Tok@@ yo in Japan. 
According to K@@ az@@ u@@ h@@ iro Do@@ i, general director of Public Rel@@ ations for the Technolog@@ y, Research and Development of Br@@ and Man@@ ag@@ ement, the BR@@ 23@@ C is an expansion of the Security Shi@@ el@@ d of the four areas produced by N@@ iss@@ an. 
This ro@@ bo@@ t is intended to improve the ability to prevent coll@@ isions in the vehicles produced by the company. 
During the f@@ light, each bee creates its own ov@@ al personal space that is very similar to the Shi@@ el@@ d of Security developed by N@@ iss@@ an. 
But the most important element is constituted by the be@@ e's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees ang@@ le, allowing the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space. 
To recre@@ ate these visual feat@@ ures, engine@@ ers developed what they defined a laser loc@@ ator (L@@ as@@ er R@@ ange Fin@@ der). 
This mechanism detec@@ ts obstacles within 2 meters and a radius up to 180 degrees in front of the BR@@ 23@@ C, calcul@@ ates the distance to the object and sends a signal to the micro@@ process@@ or on board that immediately allows preventing the coll@@ ision. 
"@@ When detec@@ ts an obstac@@ le, the little ro@@ bo@@ t imit@@ ates the be@@ e's movements and change direction immediately by turning the wheels at a right or wider angle to avoid the coll@@ ision. 
The most evident difference with any existing system is its ev@@ as@@ ive action which results to be totally instinc@@ tive. 
"@@ If it were not so, the ro@@ bo@@ t would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstac@@ les@@ " explains T@@ os@@ hi@@ y@@ uk@@ i An@@ do@@ h, director of the Laboratory of M@@ ob@@ ility and chief engine@@ er of this project. 
Un@@ like a be@@ e, the ro@@ bo@@ t can not devi@@ ate upwards or down@@ wards, or even diag@@ on@@ ally. It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction its wheels can turn to. Obvi@@ ously, it cannot run infinite directions and ways like bees do. 
For this reason, N@@ iss@@ an has used a rotation function in addition to the acceleration and dec@@ el@@ eration func@@ tions, to permit the little ro@@ bo@@ t can avoid coll@@ is@@ ions. 
"@@ This device only needs to process new information every few seconds, and acting from this data. 
It does not require to store any information or to use the intu@@ itive logic of prior man@@ eu@@ ver@@ s. For this reason it can go without interruption supplied only by a few dozen K@@ B of memor@@ y. 
This may surprise, but we are not talking of gig@@ ab@@ yt@@ es or me@@ ga of memor@@ y@@ ." 
This is the first step toward developing new technologies for the prevention of coll@@ is@@ ions, a technology N@@ iss@@ an hopes will be introduced in cars as standard feature within ten years. 
The ro@@ bo@@ t uses lithi@@ um-@@ polymer batter@@ ies, which are ligh@@ ter and more durable than the lithi@@ um-@@ ion ty@@ pol@@ og@@ y. 
An additional application in a potential future could be the integration of this technology with the GPS satellite navi@@ g@@ ator to bring the driver to a specific destination, avoiding obstacles along the path. 
Do sh@@ ud@@ der before applying for a loan 
We have to recognize that the Department of T@@ reas@@ ury of the United States, own@@ ing quite good capit@@ als to act, certainly does not lack of talent. 
Having to face the crisis and to prevent the Americans to be che@@ ated with gar@@ b@@ age loans by banks under doubts of in@@ solv@@ ency, created a fu@@ n and educational game for Internet users. This is "@@ Bad C@@ redi@@ t H@@ ot@@ el@@ ". 
In other words, the "@@ H@@ ot@@ el of the bad cred@@ it@@ s@@ "@@ ... or of the problems. 
The glo@@ om aspect of this hotel and, in particular, of its recep@@ tion@@ ist aims to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times before applying for a loan. 
And above all, to think quite carefully about where applying for it. This is probably the game primary objective. 
Certain@@ ly this system provides several useful information, but offers rather few detail@@ s. 
It's much more a web page for te@@ ens than a site for the general public. 
What happens if you complete the game@@ ? 
Well, a dream@@ -@@ room appears inside the hot@@ el. 
It is still something, because about buying a house@@ … better to leave it. 
Morgan St@@ an@@ ley opened its capital to M@@ UF@@ G 
Morgan St@@ an@@ ley has announced its entry to the table round of Mit@@ sub@@ ish@@ i UF@@ J Financial Group (M@@ UF@@ G@@ ), the first bank of Japan, who will spend nine billion dollars to obtain 21% of its capital, news that has been received by a sharp drop in share prices. 
A week after un@@ ve@@ iling a provisional agreement, the two banks have explained that M@@ UF@@ G would buy 9.9% of Morgan St@@ an@@ ley shares at a price of 25.@@ 25 dollar@@ s, tot@@ alling three billion dollar@@ s. 
The selling price is less than 19% of the value of the securi@@ ties on 31 August@@ . 
M@@ UF@@ G will invest an extra six billion dollars in the acquisition of conver@@ tible tit@@ les providing a secured yield of 10% and with a conversion price of 3@@ 1.25 dollar@@ s. 
Morgan St@@ an@@ ley affir@@ med that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of 29 dollar@@ s, or 28% above its current price. 
However, Morgan St@@ an@@ ley shares lost 6.@@ 79% down to 2@@ 3.@@ 07 dollars around 17@@ :@@ 00 GM@@ T. 
"@@ This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan St@@ an@@ ley to the status of holding bank@@ ," said Joh@@ n M@@ ack@@ , the CE@@ O of the American group. 
Morgan St@@ an@@ ley has adopted this new status last week, which should enable it to diver@@ si@@ fy its activities but it has to pass through the authority of the Federal Res@@ er@@ ve. 
Its alliance with M@@ UF@@ G also confirms that the current financial crisis forced the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before. 
The mod@@ alities presented on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days@@ : the previous Monday, Morgan had just announced it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $ 8.5 billion. 
"@@ A week ago, explained T@@ os@@ hi@@ hide M@@ iz@@ u@@ no, executive director of M@@ UF@@ G in Tok@@ y@@ o@@ ," we thought that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares. 
But given the current state of the economy and market, we hoped to minimize the risks and to protect our back@@ s.@@ " 
Based on the weighted average price M@@ UF@@ G will pay for its Morgan St@@ an@@ ley securi@@ ties 7% below their book value. 
And the transaction will result in a dilution of around 20% ear@@ nings per sha@@ re. 
The agreement forese@@ es that M@@ UF@@ G may convert annually half of its preferred securi@@ ties into ordinary shares if these traded more than 50% above the conversion price, about $ 47 for a given period. 
Morgan St@@ an@@ ley assu@@ res that the capital provided by M@@ UF@@ G will enable it to seiz@@ e investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liqu@@ id@@ ity. 
a spok@@ es@@ person for the group, however, refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new alli@@ es. 
After the investment of M@@ UF@@ G, Morgan St@@ an@@ ley forecasts a capital ratio T@@ ier One of about 15@@ %, one of the best in the industry. 
Morgan said to have "@@ signific@@ ant@@ ly@@ " reduced its balance sheet since the end of August@@ . 
Recent weeks have been difficult for the group, which saw half its share price mel@@ t away while the insurance costs against the risk of de@@ fault on its debt so@@ ared. 
This cost reduced on Monday but remained at a new high level, around 12@@ %. 
Last week, G@@ old@@ man S@@ ach@@ s, the only other surviving major investment bank on Wall Street after the bankrup@@ tcy of Be@@ ar Ste@@ ar@@ ns and Leh@@ man Bro@@ thers and Mer@@ r@@ ill Lyn@@ ch acquis@@ i@@ tion, announced it had raised $ 15 billion, partly from Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away, the group of War@@ ren B@@ uff@@ et@@ t.

Re@@ building around the Republic of the twenty-@@ first century socialism. 
This is the joint project of the Venezuel@@ an Hugo Chá@@ ve@@ z, E@@ vo Mor@@ ales of Bolivi@@ a, and the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ ian R@@ af@@ a@@ el Corre@@ a. 
This Sun@@ day, like its counter@@ parts and friends, it is the third to put to a vote a draft for a new constitu@@ tion. 
Mis@@ sion accomplished since 6@@ 4% of voters voted "@@ y@@ es@@ " to referendum, according to official results based on 80% of the votes. 
Based on these results, the "@@ no@@ " got 28@@ %, 7% of the votes were inval@@ id, and 0.@@ 7% were bl@@ ank votes. 
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes plus one. 
Sun@@ day, two poll@@ s conducted outside the polling stations and one non-governmental organization had announced a large victory for the "@@ y@@ es@@ ", of the range between 63% and 70@@ %. 
R@@ af@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea had claimed during the night from Sun@@ day to Monday the victory of his draft constitu@@ tion. 
The "@@ Constitution has triumphed so overwhel@@ ming@@ ly@@ ," he assu@@ red, comm@@ ending the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ ans in the government headquarters in Gu@@ ay@@ aqu@@ il, 280 km sou@@ th@@ west of Qu@@ it@@ o. 
As of course, R@@ af@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea was congratul@@ ated by Cha@@ vez and Mor@@ ales but also by his Chilean counterpart Michel@@ le Bachel@@ et. 
The poll@@ , which was conducted peacefully under the scrutiny of the Organization of American States (O@@ AS@@ ), covered in its text 4@@ 44 points which consolid@@ ate the "@@ new soci@@ alism@@ " advoc@@ ated by the presid@@ ent. 
The draft constitution ensh@@ r@@ ines the power of the state over the economy, by reserv@@ ing it the "@@ development plann@@ ing" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign money that they send to their emig@@ r@@ ants. 
Bu@@ o@@ yed by Cor@@ rea, elected in 2006, the project also provides greater powers to the Head of State, which can carry up to two consecutive terms of four years and will be able to dissolve the Assemb@@ ly. 
Cor@@ rea has already announced that he would use that power to seek a new mandate in February 2009. 
The Constitution also consolid@@ ates the principle of free health services and education that the president has begun to establish in this country of 13.@@ 9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line. 
It also forese@@ es the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will terminate the agreement between Qu@@ it@@ o and Washington for using E@@ cu@@ ador as a launch base for U@@ .@@ S. anti@@ drug operations. 
The 19 hostages were released in C@@ had 
An Egyp@@ tian commando squ@@ ad launched an assaul@@ t against the kid@@ n@@ ap@@ pers of the eleven tourists and their eight es@@ cor@@ ts cap@@ tured ten days ago. 
They are in Ca@@ iro@@ . 
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyp@@ tian es@@ cor@@ ts held cap@@ tive for ten days in the desert have been returned on Monday afterno@@ on un@@ harmed to the Egyp@@ tian capit@@ al. 
In the morning, they were released by an Egyp@@ tian commando in Cha@@ d. 
Ap@@ parently f@@ it, the hostages arrived around 15@@ 30 hours ab@@ o@@ ard a special plane at the military base of al@@ -M@@ az@@ a, attached to the international airport of Ca@@ iro@@ . 
They were immediately transfer@@ red, without being able to speak to the press, via helicop@@ ter to the hospital in Ma@@ adi@@ , a residential sub@@ ur@@ b of Ca@@ iro, to undergo examinations. 
They are in "@@ good health@@ ", and "@@ no ran@@ so@@ m was pa@@ id@@ " to the cap@@ tor@@ s@@ ", declared the Egyp@@ tian Minister for T@@ ouris@@ m, Z@@ ohe@@ ir Gar@@ ann@@ a, on the tarmac@@ . 
Cap@@ tured on September 19 during a saf@@ ari in a 4@@ x@@ 4 at the foot of Mount O@@ u@@ an@@ at at borders with Egyp@@ t, Sudan and Lib@@ ya, this group of hostages had been tos@@ sed around from one hi@@ de@@ out to another by 35 unknown kid@@ n@@ ap@@ pers. 
It includes 11 tourists - five Itali@@ ans, five German@@ s and a Romanian - and also eight Egyp@@ ti@@ an@@ s: two guid@@ es, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency A@@ eg@@ ypt@@ ous, organiz@@ er of the saf@@ ari@@ . 
An Egyp@@ tian security official said that 30 members of the special forc@@ es, carried ab@@ o@@ ard two helicop@@ ters, had launched the assaul@@ t during the night just before da@@ wn. 
"@@ A fire exchange ensu@@ ed, and half of the kid@@ n@@ ap@@ pers were killed, the other half fle@@ d@@ ", said the official who requested an@@ ony@@ mit@@ y. 
He said that 150 members of the Egyp@@ tian special forces "@@ rapid response@@ " unit have been sent to Sudan as a whole, where they received support from German and Italian comm@@ and@@ os. 
The head of the Italian diplomatic cor@@ ps Franco Fr@@ att@@ ini in Bel@@ grade where he currently is, mentioned the role played by Italian secret agents and elements of the special forces. 
"@@ We must recognize that we have achieved this result through the profession@@ alism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services, from the special forc@@ es@@ ," he said, without further detail@@ s. 
He also denied paying a ran@@ som@@ . 
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4@@ x@@ 4 pat@@ rol vehicle on board of which were the cap@@ tors, killing si@@ x, including the Cha@@ dian head, and arrest@@ ing two. 
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Dar@@ fur@@ , the Sudan Lib@@ eration Mov@@ ement@@ -@@ Un@@ ity (S@@ L@@ A-@@ U@@ ), something that this movement has immediately deni@@ ed. 
Let@@ ters - The silent majority of culture 
A debate on the financing of culture made the head@@ lines and has en@@ gro@@ s@@ sed this electoral campaign. 
Go@@ od. 
But one sector of our cultural life always remains forgotten. 
Who will come forward to den@@ ounce the mis@@ ery that is granted to small muse@@ ums, arch@@ iv@@ es, archaeological or national historical sites which are starving for fund@@ ing? 
Which politician da@@ res to remind the federal government that it is neglec@@ ting its monum@@ ents and heritage build@@ ings? 
In Que@@ bec@@ , in Canada, we have no real laws that effectively preserve our her@@ it@@ age? 
Did you know that the French government de@@ votes three and a half million Euro just for the restoration of the castle of Chin@@ on in the Lo@@ ire Val@@ le@@ y? 
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of American culture and that such heritage must be protected by all the citizens, all the elected and all the government depart@@ ments, and this, in co-@@ operation. 
In Que@@ bec@@ , the Federation of Soci@@ eties of Que@@ be@@ c history, at least 40 000 volunteers group@@ ed in 211 agencies for history, her@@ it@@ age, arch@@ ives and gene@@ alog@@ y are concerned with research@@ ing the history, with preserv@@ ing, having few funds, pil@@ es of private arch@@ iv@@ es, and preserv@@ ing archaeological remains. 
They often are the watch@@ dogs of our her@@ it@@ age, who protest with the energy of despair when develop@@ ers and construc@@ tors launch their bulldoz@@ ers against our old buildings and our forgotten ce@@ meter@@ ies. 
When will there be a forum for history and her@@ it@@ age? 
For@@ tis bank partially nation@@ alized by Ben@@ el@@ ux governments 
Ben@@ el@@ ux states help For@@ tis, the Belgi@@ an-@@ Dutch bank - which is the first European financial institute in trouble due to the follow-@@ through effect of the American l@@ ending crisis - by a partial state bu@@ you@@ t. The three countries have agreed to inject EUR 11.@@ 2 billion into the banking and insurance company having Hungarian interests. 
At the end of this week, the Belgian, the Luxembourg and the Dutch governments consulted on this issue at the highest level, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the Competi@@ tion Commissioner of the European Commission. 
Within the Euro zone, For@@ tis is the first bank hit by the international financial crisis approaching in waves in the last 12 months. Thus, from a certain point of view, the decisions made may be considered preced@@ ent. 
Under the decision made on Sun@@ day night, each government will take a 49 percent stake in For@@ tis banks in their respective countries. 
The bank will certainly sell some part of its stak@@ es, especially the insurance activities, which it purchased from the Dutch AB@@ N Am@@ ro last year. 
For@@ tis shares started to plung@@ e deeply last week, then in the second part of the week signs of a serious crisis appeared at the company. 
An@@ aly@@ sts agree that the bank - with its 85 000 employees - is too big to be allowed to go bankrup@@ t. 
The shares of the bank fell by 12% on Fri@@ day, which is the record lowest level for 14 years. 
The value of the shares has been dropped by two thirds since Janu@@ ary. 
Considering the current stock prices, the entire market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion. However, company direc@@ tors say this does not reflect reality. 
The management blam@@ es the uncertain@@ ties overseas - which are linked to accepting the American package of USD 700 billion - for the fall of For@@ tis shares. 
The stocks showed a slight rise on Mon@@ day. 
F@@ ili@@ p Di@@ erc@@ k@@ x was appointed the new chief executive officer of the bank on Fri@@ day. 
The financial institute was also seeking private buyers but no subst@@ an@@ tive offer has been made so far@@ . 
The Belgian government declared earlier that the invest@@ ors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money. 
No panic has emerged so far among the customers of the bank@@ ; no bank r@@ ush has taken place. 
For@@ tis has an own banking establishment in Hungary and has bought out le@@ asing companies, too. 
Fo@@ x In The Hen@@ house 
The American life and health insurance companies often refuse to sell insurance to some citizens, due to their drug purchase data. 
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrollab@@ le. 
"@@ There is a data protection programme that requires the permission of the person concerned in order to use the drug prescription data. 
It should be independent, otherwise the fo@@ x will be guarding the h@@ en-@@ house@@ ", The Washington Post quot@@ es Richard D@@ ick@@ , develop@@ er of the programme applicable for tracking drug prescrip@@ tions. 
In@@ surance companies decide on the insurance fee and the amount to be paid in case of damages depending on the health condition of the applying custom@@ er, and if they consider it too risk@@ y, they do not provide insurance. 
The applying customers used to be sent to have a medical examination performed, and the contract was concluded in light of the screening results only. 
D@@ ick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago@@ : on the basis of the custom@@ er's identification number the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 18 months can be easily detected, thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condition. 
For instance, the case of regularly buying big doses of cholesterol@@ -@@ reducing drugs practically refers to the fact that the customer has un@@ treat@@ ably high blood fat level, as a result of which this person would immediately be put to a higher risk category. 
The programme has various versions in trade, some of them even defin@@ es the risk factor, thus the insurance company has nothing else to do but the paper@@ work, though smaller difficulties arise. 
One of the disadvantages is the fact that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example some medical formula are to treat migraine, heat waves or even depression. 
The latter one is a significant risk-@@ increasing factor from the view of business insu@@ rers, while the other two are not. 
There are specific companies dealing with obtaining and processing data, and they ask permission from the patient before acqu@@ iring the necessary information from the pharmac@@ ies. 
They are already obliged to do so, though their previous failures have not been penaliz@@ ed. 
Some companies process even the results of laboratory examinations and connect those to drug consumption data. This way they can provide more accurate information on the patients' health condition. 
More and more companies gain access to the data and, in parallel, the control of their use become increasingly difficult. 
There is a specific act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care providers and insurance companies. 
The bill on providing inspection power for the authorities over companies dealing with data provision has been submitted to the Congres@@ s. 
D@@ ick Richard re@@ aliz@@ es that it is not enough@@ : that is why he has further developed his programme, which would now restrict data transfer in respect of requiring the expressed consent of the person concerned. 
It is another question, though, that the applicant cannot really refuse cons@@ ent, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude contract with them. 
So h@@ ens, to a certain degre@@ e, will continue to depend on the ben@@ evol@@ ence of the fo@@ x. 
Global Marse@@ ille Men@@ u 
European Union and India Dou@@ bles Trade 
As the European Union and India are leading trade partners of each other, the agenda of the ninth summit was also domin@@ ated by this issue in addition to other, mainly global, problems. 
Today a Franc@@ e-@@ India Summit is going to be held, too, particularly about nuclear power co-@@ operation. 
Though the European Union recogniz@@ es that India is an emerging democratic world-@@ power, which should be granted more say in international affairs, the member states have not been able to come to an agreement yet whether to support the permanent membership of New Del@@ hi in UN Security Council or not. 
Thus this matter was not forced during the ninth summit, organ@@ ized in Marse@@ ille yester@@ day. 
French President Nic@@ ol@@ as S@@ ark@@ oz@@ y as Rot@@ ating President of the Union, Committee President José Manuel Barroso and Foreign Policy Chief J@@ avi@@ er Sol@@ ana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Man@@ mo@@ han Sing@@ h and agreed to double@@ , i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros, the trade flow in 5 years. 
Since exchange of goods raised from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious objective. 
Accordingly, 26 existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with India have been legally harmoniz@@ ed, meaning that air traffic can wing in the future. 
India aims to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009. 
S@@ ark@@ oz@@ y promised to accelerate harmoniz@@ ing. 
The goal is to find the balance while India is number one trade partner of the EU, at the same time New Del@@ hi has only the ninth place on the list of EU partners. 
The summit concentrated on global issu@@ es: 
On the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as on terrorism. The latter was condemned in every form by both parties and conven@@ ing the UN Conference was urg@@ ed. 
The completion of Doh@@ a Trade R@@ ound was also exp@@ ed@@ ited, although both parties are responsible for the fi@@ asco so far@@ . 
The EU confirmed to maintain its energy and climate programme, meaning to have the intention to cut air pollutants emission by at least 20 per cent until 2020. 
India agreed with this as well as with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate conference which is due next year and to decrease greenhouse gas emission by 50 percent until 2050. 
Another goal was to prevent the growth of food prices and a call for an international conference to review financial crisis was supported. 
The Indian Prime Minister is going to a bilateral meeting in the French capital today, where he intends to come to an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear power.

F@@ ound the aeroplane of Ste@@ ve Fos@@ set@@ t the million@@ aire disappeared a year ago 
The wreck of the aeroplane of Ste@@ ve Fos@@ set@@ t, the million@@ aire who disappeared on the 3@@ rd September 2007 while flying over the N@@ ev@@ ada deser@@ t, has been found. 
The wrec@@ k@@ age has been found on a pl@@ ate@@ au at 3000 metres al@@ titu@@ de, in the Si@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ada area of Mam@@ mot@@ h L@@ ak@@ es, at the border between Califor@@ nia and N@@ ev@@ ada. 
In@@ side the air@@ plan@@ e, however, there were no human remains. 
The Mad@@ era Coun@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff@@ , Joh@@ n Ander@@ son, has disp@@ elled any remaining doub@@ ts: "@@ The aeroplane has been loc@@ ated, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which Ste@@ ve Fol@@ let@@ t was flying the day he dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d@@ " he said in a press conferenc@@ e. 
After@@ wards, the sh@@ er@@ iff pointed out that no human remains have been found either on the plan@@ e, nor in the surrounding area. 
The million@@ ai@@ re, 63 years old, was given up for dead in Febru@@ ary. 
The American National Transport Safety Bureau (N@@ T@@ S@@ B) has reported that some hours after the wreck was spotted an investig@@ atory team was s@@ ent, that has then identified the aircraf@@ t: it is the Bell@@ anca 8@@ K@@ C@@ AB, which has been missing since 3@@ rd September 2007, when Fos@@ set@@ t took off from Y@@ er@@ ing@@ ton in N@@ ev@@ ada for a three hour f@@ light. 
Yester@@ day, always in Califor@@ nia, not far from the border with N@@ ev@@ ada, some personal effects belonging to Fos@@ set@@ t were found by a couple near their house in Mam@@ mot@@ h L@@ ak@@ es. 
The items are two documents in the name of Fos@@ set@@ t, both issued by the Federal Avi@@ ation Administration of Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is, some cas@@ h, and a sweat@@ shir@@ t. 
The search for Fos@@ set@@ t was called off a month after he had dis@@ appeared. 
The million@@ aire had gained himself a place in history thanks to a series of world record@@ s. 
In 2002, at his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the round the world trip in a hot air ballo@@ on: a two-week sol@@ o f@@ light. 
Three years later he did the round the world trip by plane without landing. 
Among his many record@@ s, there is also flying at 15@@ ,@@ 4@@ 45 metres, above the And@@ es, but with a co-@@ pilot@@ . 
Gl@@ k, the advertising that does not awa@@ it you 
An SU@@ V which is outside the norm@@ s with an original design defined by decisive lines, am@@ ple surfaces and clean cut cor@@ ners. 
In short, this is GL@@ K, the latest addition to the "@@ comp@@ act@@ " off-@@ road vehicles from the star@@ red manufacturer, with which Merc@@ ed@@ es-@@ Ben@@ z has tried to let in a breath of fresh air into this sector. 
R@@ ight because its features are out of the traditional norm@@ s, the message accompanying the launch of the GL@@ K SU@@ V will also be unexpected and un@@ conven@@ tional, it will be available in Merc@@ ed@@ es-@@ Ben@@ z show@@ rooms as from next October 17@@ th. 
So the public@@ ity campaign that will accompany the de@@ but of the new vehicle will set off a new communication method which also includes a fut@@ ur@@ istic campaign of 3@@ D bill@@ board@@ s, used for the first time in Italy by a car br@@ and. 
A project of large bill@@ board@@ s, set in motion in three different phases, which will domin@@ ate the most central Mil@@ anese shopping stre@@ et, Cor@@ so Com@@ o, until the 15@@ th November. 
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with a presentation of the car in stere@@ os@@ copic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed in the neighbourhood of Cor@@ so Com@@ o it will be possible to see the new SU@@ V in true size and 3@@ D format. 
In fact, looking at the image one will get the sensation that the car pro@@ tr@@ udes out of the poster@@ . 
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology El@@ um@@ ina 8 all the details of the new GL@@ K will be illum@@ inated at various times, and then be re@@ composed as a single image. 
Without any doub@@ ts, Merc@@ ed@@ es, through this advertise@@ ment, is trying to introduce something new into the conventional field of autom@@ o@@ tive public@@ ity. 
Will it succeed with this formula to provoke the interest of future buy@@ ers? We will see. 
Here is who the Italian ho@@ olig@@ ans are 
of the Tri@@ -@@ Ven@@ et@@ o, liable to be banned from attending sports fix@@ tures (D@@ as@@ po@@ ). 
But who are those 150@@ -2@@ 00 people of whom Italy is now asha@@ me@@ d? They form part of the group "@@ Ultr@@ as Ital@@ ia@@ " who for years has been supporting the national football team and till now, truth be known, has never created major problems. 
Neither has it ever clas@@ hed with op@@ posing f@@ ans. 
The group@@ 's extraction is right w@@ ing. 
The promoters are from Tri@@ -@@ Ven@@ et@@ o. 
From Ver@@ ona, Pa@@ du@@ a, Triest@@ e, and U@@ d@@ ine. 
These have been joined by some small groups (in reality, very few memb@@ er@@ s) from Camp@@ ag@@ nia and P@@ ugli@@ a. 
They have tric@@ ol@@ our flags with the city of origin of the milit@@ ants on them: on Satur@@ day, these have been taken off so that they could not be identified. 
They take up their ideas from English f@@ ans. 
In Bulgaria, they found supporters who were real Naz@@ is, the Lev@@ ski group. 
The F@@ IG@@ C had put at the disposal of the Italian fans 144 tickets for the mat@@ ch: all person@@ al, hence easily check@@ able. 
And the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior at V@@ imin@@ ale had in fact checked them all@@ : among those groups going to Sof@@ ia none was banned, none had been forbidden to frequent a st@@ adi@@ um. 
Four Italian suppor@@ ters, who had previous st@@ adi@@ um-@@ related crim@@ es, had in fact been refused tickets and kept from going. 
Now the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is waiting to be able to read the official record@@ s, which should arrive from the Bulgarian police before taking steps: in this instance, it is possible to ban for five years at least the supporters that have been arrested or those that have been identified during the disturbances. 
An international ban@@ ish@@ ment which prohibits the attendance of not only st@@ adi@@ ums in Italy but also in all of Europe. 
Our ho@@ olig@@ ans, in short, would not enter another st@@ adi@@ um. 
Fortun@@ ately. 
But now there is fear of emul@@ ation: that is that others join to that little more than one hundred and fif@@ ty. 
"@@ We have to immediately put out this con@@ flag@@ ration and not legitim@@ ise those that behave in this fashion@@ ", as@@ sert those at the Ministry in V@@ imin@@ al@@ e. 
So, "@@ eyes wide open especially since there is the National team playing on Wednesday at L@@ ec@@ ce@@ ". 
In P@@ ugli@@ a in fact there is a small nucle@@ us of Ultr@@ as Italia suppor@@ ters. 
Tom@@ or@@ row the Ob@@ serv@@ atory meet@@ s, on Tuesday the C@@ AS@@ MS which can count on a section of the AI@@ SE@@ , that is the secret service, which hand@@ les exactly the problems in st@@ adi@@ um@@ s. 
"@@ The ch@@ or@@ us D@@ uc@@ e-@@ Du@@ ce and the arm stretched out during the Mam@@ el@@ i an@@ them? In Bulgaria it's not a cri@@ me@@ ...@@ ". 
These are the thoughts (@@ expressed with great disappoint@@ ment@@ ) of D@@ omen@@ ic@@ o Maz@@ z@@ illi@@ , who, as of a few weeks ago, is the director of the Ob@@ serv@@ atory of the V@@ imin@@ ale (@@ he achieved the post which was initially held by Francesco T@@ ag@@ li@@ ent@@ e and then by Fel@@ ice Fer@@ li@@ zz@@ i@@ ). 
Previ@@ ously, Maz@@ z@@ illi had been head of the police administration in Trieste where there is a nucle@@ us of supporters of Ultr@@ as Ital@@ ia, founded in 2002. 
It's true, says Maz@@ z@@ illi@@ , that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to ch@@ ant hy@@ m@@ ns to the Du@@ ce but certainly the behaviour of those 150@@ -2@@ 00 fans has been disgraceful@@ . 
"@@ I am not a soci@@ ologist - adds the n@@ .@@ 1 of the Ob@@ serv@@ atory – the crime should be imp@@ uted in the country where the incident occurs. 
T@@ ill now this group has remained within the lines, now we will see what actually happened and we will evaluate it for future referenc@@ e. 
But let us also talk about the whist@@ ling to the Mam@@ el@@ i an@@ them: that is also not a crime in Bulgaria, but, if I@@ '@@ m allowed to say, it is not good mann@@ ers ...@@ ".
