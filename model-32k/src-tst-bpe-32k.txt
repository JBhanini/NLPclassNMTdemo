The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimul@@ ates, as a mit@@ os@@ is-@@ stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormone, the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compart@@ ment.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (E@@ SA@@ s) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoies@@ is-@@ stimulating agents (see section 4.@@ 8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of T@@ VE@@ s (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism@@ ).

In patients with solid tumours or lymphoproliferative malignancies, if the haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dosage adaptation described in section 4.2 should be closely respected, in order to minimise the potential risk of thromboembolic events.
Aranesp is a sterile but unpreserved product.
Because of individual variability, titration to optimal therapeutic doses is expected for individual patients.
There have been no observed effects with Aranesp on the ability to drive and use machines.
Treatment of paediatric patients younger than 1 year of age has not been studi@@ ed:
Once the therapeutic objective for an individual patient has been achieved, the dose should be reduced by 25 to 50% in order to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Aranesp is used to maintain haemoglobin at a level that controls the symptoms of anaemia.
Treatment with Aranesp is divided into two stages – correction and maintenance phase.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (@@ 6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Aranesp treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the above mentioned indications.
Anaemia symptoms and sequel@@ ae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of diseas@@ e; a physici@@ an's evaluation of the individual patient's clinical course and condition is necessary.
The initial dose by subcutaneous or intravenous administration is 0.@@ 45 µg/ kg body weight, as a single injection once week@@ ly.

The legis@@ lat@@ ors thus ignored President Ge@@ orge B@@ ush@@ 's appeal for them to support the pl@@ an. 
According to Bus@@ h, the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabil@@ ize the entire economy. 
American stocks suffered a blood@@ bath on Monday and the major stock in@@ dex@@ es registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years. 
The Do@@ w J@@ ones Index dropped by nearly seven percent@@ , having registered a similar@@ ly-@@ ranged fall the last time in 198@@ 7. 
The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall. 
Congres@@ s yiel@@ d@@ s: US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks 
The top representatives of the American Congres@@ s and Ge@@ orge W@@ . B@@ ush@@ 's cabin@@ et have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system. 
The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week. 
American legis@@ lat@@ ors made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bail@@ out plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amoun@@ ting to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion cro@@ wn@@ s). 
But all is not won yet. 
That is, the members of con@@ gres@@ s have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it. 
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives on Mon@@ day. 
The cha@@ ir of the Financial Services Committee, Bar@@ ney Fran@@ k, told Re@@ u@@ ters this on Sun@@ day. 
S@@ ourc@@ es say that the sen@@ ate could evidently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the soon@@ est. 
Econom@@ ists say that the announcement that the bail@@ out plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the re@@ vival of financial markets. 
After@@ war@@ d, however, a "@@ s@@ ob@@ ering up@@ " will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice. 
Paul@@ son@@ : Plan must be effective 
"@@ We@@ '@@ ve made great progress. 
We@@ '@@ ve resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabil@@ ization of markets should look@@ ,@@ " Democ@@ rat N@@ ancy Pel@@ os@@ i told Blo@@ om@@ b@@ erg@@ . 
According to h@@ er, the final vote could take place as early as Sun@@ day. 
Represent@@ atives of the legis@@ lat@@ ors met with American Finance Minister Hen@@ ry Paul@@ son Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form. 
The fund is meant to purchase un@@ sell@@ able mortg@@ age assets which are pulling financial companies down into heavy losses and are endang@@ ering the stability of the entire system. 
"@@ We@@ 're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market. 
I@@ t's necessary to continue in the cur@@ ative pl@@ an, but I think we@@ 're there@@ ,@@ " Paul@@ son said. 
A signal for Asian trading 
The global financial crisis is significantly imp@@ acting the stock markets, which are dropping shar@@ ply. 
According to N@@ ev@@ ada Democratic sen@@ ator Har@@ ry Re@@ id, that is how that legis@@ lat@@ ors are trying to have Congres@@ s to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sun@@ day. 
N@@ am@@ ely, by doing this they want to calm invest@@ ors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their time zon@@ es, are the first ones where the decision by Congres@@ s could influence Mon@@ day@@ 's trad@@ ing. 
In the me@@ anti@@ me, however, it is not yet clear with any certainty when both chambers of the American Congres@@ s will vote on the b@@ ill, nor whether the negotiations will not become h@@ inde@@ red by some problem. 
The legis@@ lat@@ ors hope that it will be approved in the next few days. 
However, the bill will still go through a series of changes. 
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible, as requested by president Ge@@ orge B@@ ush. 
But Congres@@ s can block the release of the remaining amount, in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later, the final 350 billion dollar@@ s, if it has the impression that the program is not ful@@ filling its function. 
B@@ ush appreci@@ ates progress in negotiations 
Th@@ ough the president can veto this decision, Congres@@ s can over@@ ride his vet@@ o. 
Even in spite of these changes, the essential idea of the program@@ , to gain fin@@ ances for the buy@@ out of bad mortg@@ age stocks, the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortg@@ ages, has remained int@@ act. 
"@@ We@@ '@@ ve drawn it all up. 
The House of Represent@@ atives should be able to vote on the bill on Sun@@ day and the Sen@@ ate on Mon@@ day@@ ,@@ " said Republic@@ an sen@@ ator J@@ ud@@ d G@@ reg@@ g. 
Even American president B@@ ush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations. 
His speaker Tony Fr@@ at@@ to declared that B@@ ush was satisfied with Satur@@ day@@ 's progress and appreci@@ ated the "@@ two-@@ party effort to stabil@@ ize our financial markets and save our econom@@ y@@ ". 
Con@@ strain@@ ing golden par@@ ach@@ utes 
The chairman of the Sen@@ ate Ban@@ king Committee, Christ@@ oph@@ er D@@ od@@ d, the chief negoti@@ ator, said that the legis@@ lat@@ ors had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program@@ , protection of the taxpayers against los@@ ses, closing of relief packag@@ es, and timing of the financial pl@@ an. 
The new law is also meant to con@@ strain the "@@ golden par@@ ach@@ ut@@ es@@ " for the heads of the companies particip@@ ating in the program and establish@@ es a committee which will over@@ see the fun@@ d. 
The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Fin@@ ance. 
"@@ We@@ '@@ ve worked very hard on this and we@@ '@@ ve made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americ@@ ans@@ ,@@ " Paul@@ son said. 
The plan also includes assistance to home@@ owners who have problems making their payments. 
The cabin@@ et should negotiate new payments for the mortg@@ ages it bu@@ ys, with the aim of lowering the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their hous@@ es. 
Mare@@ k@@ : Psych@@ ological help 
According to the chief econom@@ ist of Pat@@ ria Fin@@ ance, David Mare@@ k, the proposed plan is a good ide@@ a, but its re@@ alization will be very difficult. 
"@@ And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be b@@ ough@@ t. 
This will determine how the financial sector and the cabin@@ et will divide the losses amongst themsel@@ ves@@ ,@@ " Mare@@ k told the server i@@ H@@ N@@ ed@@ .@@ c@@ z this week. 
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant, according to Mare@@ k. 
"@@ More important is for the members of con@@ gres@@ s to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible. 
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time@@ ,@@ " Mare@@ k emphas@@ ized. 
R@@ az@@ or's edge batt@@ le@@ : MP@@ 3 players vs. cell ph@@ ones. 
Our advice on how to choose 
While nearly every cell phone can play MP@@ 3 fil@@ es, no MP@@ 3 player can make phone call@@ s. 
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a ph@@ one. 
In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP@@ 3 play@@ er. 
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future own@@ er. 
It is not likely that you will get a top@@ -of-@@ the-@@ line expensive record player in order to listen to the new@@ est al@@ b@@ um by Max@@ im Tur@@ bul@@ enc@@ . 
First of all such music products not available on L@@ P@@ s, but also, from the qualit@@ ative point of view there no objective reason for it. 
However, if your shelves are crow@@ ded with art roc@@ k, j@@ az@@ z, or blu@@ es vinyl record@@ s, you are likely at least dream@@ ing of a record player like that. 
I@@ t's the same with music on tri@@ ps, that is, com@@ pressed mus@@ ic, simply put@@ , MP@@ 3 mus@@ ic. 
There are price and qualit@@ ative categories here as well. 
For som@@ e, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand cro@@ wn@@ s on an MP@@ 3 play@@ er, just as it is hard for P@@ ink F@@ loy@@ d f@@ an to accept twenty-@@ cro@@ wn head@@ ph@@ ones from a market h@@ all. 
Two extrem@@ es, between which there is enough space for everyone. 
The selection is broad@@ . 
B@@ at@@ ter@@ y life also decides 
Some top@@ -of-@@ the-@@ line music players can do much more than merely play mus@@ ic, but also what most cell ph@@ ones can@@ 't even do by ch@@ ance. 
No contem@@ por@@ ary machine is as universal as the teleph@@ one. 
In addition to the primary func@@ tions, calling and text@@ ing, it can play music and vide@@ o, record bo@@ th, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navi@@ gate in some cases. 
And when we take sm@@ art ph@@ ones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pock@@ et. 
I@@ t's a small mirac@@ le, as there is no refrigerator that knows how to gr@@ ill and no television can take pic@@ tures. 
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvant@@ ages. 
The more functions you use on your cell ph@@ one, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charg@@ er. 
And playing music is one of the biggest energy gu@@ zz@@ l@@ ers. 
Very few cell ph@@ ones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less. 
In this way, music players (particularly the simpl@@ est on@@ es) are much more effici@@ ent. 
Which is why you should count on the fact that in@@ expensive cell ph@@ ones will not play for more than a few hours. 
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that, to be on the safe side, get another charg@@ er for your workplace - even for more expensive devic@@ es. 
You won@@ 't have this problem with MP@@ 3 play@@ ers, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge. 
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell ph@@ one. 
Unfortunately, only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal US@@ B connec@@ tor, and on top of that, not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special sof@@ t@@ wa@@ re. 
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the mini@@ ature memory cards used in the cell ph@@ ones without an adap@@ tor. 
For the music play@@ ers, with some exceptions (@@ i@@ P@@ od@@ ), you don't need any special sof@@ t@@ wa@@ re. 
I@@ t's enough to fill the device with music using the US@@ B from the compu@@ ter. 
Most cell ph@@ ones and music players already create a music library by themselves, organ@@ ized according to the arti@@ st@@ 's name, al@@ b@@ um tit@@ le, gen@@ re, or, e.@@ g., user rat@@ ing. 
Some devices only display the tree structure of the director@@ y, similar to Win@@ do@@ ws Ex@@ plo@@ rer and some are able to do both (@@ iri@@ ver, Sam@@ sun@@ g, Son@@ y, Co@@ w@@ on, sm@@ art ph@@ ones with an operating system@@ s). 
Mus@@ ic players easier to service, cell ph@@ ones can do more 
In cho@@ osing specific equipment, you should be interested above all in the life of the batter@@ y, the capacity of the memor@@ y, the quality and type of the audi@@ o out@@ put@@ , and of course also the user@@ -friendly nature of the operation. 
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while, perhaps in the tr@@ am, any cell phone which plays MP@@ 3 is enough. 
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do. 
You don't even have to pay too much attention to which music form@@ ats the cell phone or music player can hand@@ le. 
The MP@@ 3 can handle all of them, and in fact, most of the music you will get will be in this very form@@ at. 
It one of the most widespread form@@ ats and in addition to it, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in W@@ MA form@@ at. 
Less common is the appearance of A@@ AC (the format used by the Ap@@ ple company and its i@@ P@@ od@@ s). 
Better cell ph@@ ones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-@@ line. 
All you have to do to buy a song or al@@ b@@ um is visit the pages of the given operator (or another provi@@ der@@ ) using mobile Internet. 
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell ph@@ one. 
Unfortunately the off@@ er@@ ings from the operators are pal@@ try and are usually limited to fast-@@ growing radio h@@ its. 
The prices are also not among the lo@@ we@@ st. 
It is generally assu@@ med, however, that this very manner of music sales (@@ whether using GS@@ M, the Internet or wireless Interne@@ t) will take over the music industry in the future. 
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times. 
Wh@@ en@@ ever you feel like list@@ ening to something, you can reach for your cell phone in your pock@@ et, while the MP@@ 3 player lies at home, forgotten. 
However, it still depends on whether you always have head@@ ph@@ ones or at least the w@@ ire hand@@ s@@ -free with you. 
If not, you can utili@@ ze the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell ph@@ ones, but only in a minimum of MP@@ 3 play@@ ers. 
But the greatest advantage of the music cell ph@@ ones for many people is the price. 
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand cro@@ wn@@ s. 
For three or four thousand cro@@ wn@@ s, you can get a very decent walk@@ man. 
Usually, however, you@@ '@@ l@@ l be limited by the absence of output on ordinary head@@ ph@@ ones. 
The best and most technically well-@@ equipped teleph@@ ones, with a 3.5 mm j@@ ack for ordinary head@@ ph@@ ones, cost up to fifteen thousand cro@@ wn@@ s. 
The advantage of the music play@@ ers, on the other hand, is, among other reasons, that they are easy to oper@@ ate. 
Anyone can handle the operation of the simpl@@ est - not necessarily the most in@@ expensive (see our selec@@ tion) - music play@@ ers. 
The minimum of functions and simil@@ arity in operation to the form@@ erly common cas@@ set@@ te rec@@ order or even the record player is apparent. 
There is no threat of a cl@@ ash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data trans@@ mis@@ sion. 
What device to reach for 
Even the least expensive cell ph@@ ones (e.g. V@@ od@@ af@@ one 5@@ 27) generally have a s@@ lot for re@@ place@@ able memory cards (@@ of the type M@@ 2, micro@@ SD and the lik@@ e). 
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card, you will spend less than two thousand cro@@ wn@@ s. 
Be careful@@ , however. 
With the basic mod@@ els, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 G@@ B tend to be supported. 
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 G@@ B memory car@@ ds. 
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an in@@ expensive MP@@ 3 play@@ er, reach for Co@@ w@@ on, Cre@@ ativ@@ , Son@@ y, Sam@@ sun@@ g, E@@ mg@@ et@@ on or iri@@ ver. 
Based on capacity (@@ maximum 2 GB@@ ) you don't have to spend more than 1,@@ 100 cro@@ wn@@ s. 
If you are a more demanding list@@ en@@ er, reach instead for speci@@ alized cell ph@@ ones - walk@@ man (S@@ ony E@@ ric@@ s@@ son, some N@@ ok@@ ia and Sam@@ sun@@ g model@@ s). 
These devices have separate control butt@@ ons for MP@@ 3 and the user@@ -friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP@@ 3 play@@ er. 
S@@ ony E@@ ric@@ s@@ son, whose cell ph@@ ones from the walk@@ man series have the same user inter@@ face as the MP@@ 3 players sold separ@@ ately, is the most advanced in the field. 
The MP@@ 3 players from the br@@ ands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand cro@@ wn@@ s, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB@@ ) and battery en@@ dur@@ ance (@@ normally 15 hours, maxim@@ ally up to 35 hour@@ s). 
First virtu@@ al operator to arrive in Cz@@ ec@@ hia this year. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in Cz@@ ec@@ hia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
In spite of this, there is something missing here - a virtu@@ al operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices. 
It might be missing for a long time. 
We have already written many times on M@@ obil@@ .@@ c@@ z about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bure@@ au@@ , who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union. 
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the ro@@ am@@ ing fe@@ es, a paradox@@ ical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home. 
How is it possible that the prices in Cz@@ ec@@ hia remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competi@@ tors who would really like to enter into batt@@ le. 
Perhaps it sounds paradox@@ ical, after all, we have three mobile networks here and over 100% cover@@ age. 
M@@ obile oper@@ ators, on the other hand, like to pre@@ tend that the Czech market is extremely competi@@ tive. 
This is often secon@@ ded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau (C@@ T@@ B) P@@ avel D@@ vo@@ ř@@ á@@ k, who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Cz@@ ec@@ hi@@ a. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for that matter, it would be very difficult to find frequ@@ enci@@ es). 
But there is one more opportunity - a virtu@@ al oper@@ ator. 
It is precisely the entr@@ ance of the virtu@@ al operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to react. 
At the same time, even before the entr@@ ance on the market of aggressive competi@@ tors such as T@@ esc@@ o M@@ obile or Virg@@ in M@@ obil@@ e, voices similar to those here could be hear@@ d. 
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful. 
For that matter, we don't have to go far to find exampl@@ es. 
In February of this year, we informed you of the start of the virtu@@ al operator M@@ obil@@ king in Poland. 
Over the course of merely half a year, this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest oper@@ ator. 
At the same time, the financial group Pent@@ a, which own@@ s, among others, U@@ :@@ f@@ on, stands behind M@@ obil@@ king. 
The advantage of the virtu@@ al operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group. 
In order to function effectively, they require many fewer customers than a classic operator do@@ es. 
That is, they do not carry the relatively high costs of construc@@ tion, operation and maintenance of a mobile net@@ work. 
In this way, virtu@@ al operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-@@ cost - they offer in@@ expensive calling and text mess@@ ages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though. 
Th@@ at@@ 's how, for example, T@@ esc@@ o M@@ obile in Great Britain can offer text mess@@ aging for at least fif@@ ty percent less than its competitors. 
But as the example of M@@ obil@@ king in Poland show@@ s, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a no@@ vel target group. 
That is, this operator is specifically oriented toward men. 
"@@ Re@@ al men choose M@@ obil@@ king - the operator that they like and can trust@@ ,@@ " says David Se@@ iber@@ t, the CE@@ O of M@@ obile Enter@@ tain@@ ment Com@@ pan@@ y, which runs this virtu@@ al oper@@ ator. 
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here. 
Mi@@ ros@@ lav Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý@@ , spok@@ es@@ man for V@@ od@@ af@@ one, doubts this: "@@ The Czech market is relatively small for the seg@@ mented approach on which most virtu@@ al operators are foun@@ ded. 
In addition, it's relatively satur@@ ated from the perspective of the offer of servic@@ es@@ ." 
No chance in Cz@@ ec@@ hi@@ a, say mobile operators 
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtu@@ al operator in Cz@@ ec@@ hi@@ a, it won@@ 't be M@@ obil@@ king. 
"@@ We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Cz@@ ec@@ hia don't look very hop@@ eful@@ . 
More lik@@ ely, M@@ obil@@ king will be launched in other countries in our region@@ ,@@ " said J@@ ana Stud@@ ni@@ č@@ k@@ ová@@ , speaker for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for M@@ obil@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Cz@@ ec@@ hia are definitely not inclined toward this ide@@ a. 
Ra@@ ther, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into exist@@ ence. 
For a longer period of time now, the G@@ TS N@@ over@@ a group has made no secret of its interest in laun@@ ching a virtu@@ al mobile oper@@ ator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Tel@@ ef@@ on@@ ica O@@ 2 in the area of corporate cli@@ ent@@ el@@ e. 
"@@ We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hard@@ w@@ ire telecommunic@@ ation services, but also mobile ones. 
The soon@@ er, the better. 
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile oper@@ ators. 
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them@@ ,@@ " said the group@@ 's spok@@ es@@ man, P@@ avel Ka@@ id@@ l. 
Perhaps there are better times a@@ head. 
On the basis of uno@@ ffic@@ ial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtu@@ al operator as early as the end of this year. 
In the me@@ anti@@ me, however, its creation is accompanied by a wall of sil@@ ence. 
"@@ At this time, we do not think that there is space for the creation of a ful@@ l@@ -f@@ ledg@@ ed virtu@@ al oper@@ ator. 
Compared to other markets, the Czech market is very specific. 
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this are@@ a@@ ,@@ " claimed V@@ las@@ tim@@ il S@@ r@@ š@@ e@@ ň from the public relations depart@@ ment of Tel@@ ef@@ on@@ ica 02 in a statement for M@@ obil@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market. 
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O@@ 2, T@@ -M@@ obile spok@@ es@@ woman Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ ro@@ v@@ á ad@@ ded: "@@ We have not yet registered a viable and bil@@ ater@@ ally advant@@ ageous business project that it would be possible to build up@@ on@@ ." 
And she ad@@ ded: "@@ No virtu@@ al operator is likely to appear in the T@@ -M@@ obile network by the end of the year. 
At this moment, in order to be talking about such a short time@@ fra@@ me, we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table@@ ." 
V@@ od@@ af@@ one is placing its attention more upon ful@@ filling the requirements of its own 3@@ G licen@@ se. 
Regarding this, Mi@@ ros@@ lav Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý said: "@@ We are open to negotiations with potential virtu@@ al oper@@ ators, above all in the area of shared costs and infra@@ structure. 
From the perspective of the custom@@ ers, we consider this to be the most benefici@@ al. 
V@@ od@@ af@@ one's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Interne@@ t@@ ." 
Respon@@ sible authorities - bud@@ d@@ y-@@ bud@@ dy with operators 
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entr@@ ance of another operator would mean increased competition, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits. 
Why, then, make this entr@@ ance easy for such a competi@@ tor@@ ? 
The tu@@ g@@ -of-@@ war surrounding the creation of U@@ :@@ f@@ on at@@ tests to the fact that when something is important to the oper@@ ators, they are able to pull for the same team. 
Pro@@ bably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telecommunic@@ ation Office was during the time of the creation of U@@ :@@ f@@ on by T@@ -M@@ obil@@ e. 
Information public@@ ly available from the Czech Telecommunic@@ ation Offic@@ e's web pages at@@ tests to this. 
But now this is a suitable argument for U@@ :@@ f@@ on to not allow the entr@@ ance of the virtu@@ al oper@@ ator. 
Regarding that matter, Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ ro@@ v@@ á pointed out@@ : "@@ The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently amp@@ li@@ fied by the entr@@ ance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market. 
Consi@@ dering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the entr@@ ance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its servic@@ es@@ ." 
But considering this approach by the mobile oper@@ ators, the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is, in fact, start@@ ling. 
This means not only the attitude of the CT@@ O, which unfortunately in Cz@@ ec@@ hia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition. 
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competi@@ tion (@@ OP@@ C) exclusiv@@ ely. 
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue. 
"@@ The entr@@ ance of a virtu@@ al operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the ren@@ tal of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtu@@ al oper@@ ator. 
No such contract has ever been sign@@ ed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic oper@@ ator@@ s@@ ,@@ " claimed K@@ risti@@ án Ch@@ alu@@ pa from the external relations depart@@ ment of the OP@@ C in his answer to our question. 
A statement formul@@ ated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won@@ 't surprise any@@ one. 
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one ab@@ uses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious. 
All the more so when K@@ risti@@ án Ch@@ alu@@ pa ad@@ ded: "@@ In other countries, where virtu@@ al operators commonly function, we can observe that their entr@@ ance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone servic@@ es@@ ." 
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OP@@ C. 
In truth, the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmon@@ y between the three mobile operators that is implic@@ it in their reactions. 
The question as to whether this is really just a co@@ incidence arises entirely by itself. 
Just like the exact same price of gas@@ ol@@ ine at the gas stations is surely just the product of co@@ incidence and the tough competitive batt@@ le. 
"@@ The Office did not find any signs of actions viol@@ ating the rules of competition, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way. 
None of the operators have a domin@@ ant position, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market. 
The telecommunic@@ ations regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtu@@ al oper@@ ator@@ s@@ ,@@ " Ch@@ alu@@ pa claimed in his stat@@ ement. 
The interpretation of the domin@@ ant position on the market is one of the disp@@ uted points. 
Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CT@@ O, according to which telecommunic@@ ations are, from the perspective of competition, the only market. 
On such a market, none of the Czech operators then have a domin@@ ant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtu@@ al oper@@ ator, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network oper@@ ator. 
And the mobile operator - entirely log@@ ically - has a monopoly on its net@@ work. 
So in a certain seg@@ ment, it must necessarily be domin@@ ant. 
But even if we did not consider this argum@@ ent, for the OP@@ C it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proce@@ eding in a stri@@ k@@ ingly similar manner. 
At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the G@@ TS N@@ over@@ a company mentioned abov@@ e) demonstrate that they are encoun@@ tering very similar hur@@ d@@ les in their negotiations with all the oper@@ ators. 
Plac@@ ing the responsibility on the CT@@ O is a rather common trick in telecommunic@@ ations, through which the OP@@ C can have nothing to do with the whole matter. 
We have already encoun@@ tered it in several similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the extension of the CT@@ O@@ 's authority to the area of competition in telecommunic@@ ations in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Ac@@ t, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation. 
The representatives of the OP@@ C must know this very well, but their interests are evidently elsewhere. 
It can be done when no@@ body's looking 
At the same time, the functioning of some pseud@@ o-@@ virtu@@ al oper@@ ators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile net@@ works, remains un@@ notic@@ ed. 
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, which are only partially public. 
These are usually companies dealing with multi@@ level marketing. 
For example, Am@@ way, B@@ oh@@ emia Telec@@ om, Star@@ life and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services. 
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals. 
The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the oper@@ ator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SI@@ M car@@ ds. 
As a significant cli@@ ent, it then gets special price offers (and other types of off@@ er@@ s). 
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sal@@ es. 
"@@ If the cases you are talking about were to occur, this could be a viol@@ ation of the contract conditions, which we would investig@@ ate, and it could cul@@ min@@ ate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company@@ ,@@ " Mart@@ ina K@@ em@@ ro@@ v@@ á answered our question on this problem. 
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile oper@@ ators. 
This could be a question of thousands of custom@@ ers, above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above. 
But at the same time, none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure. 
N@@ am@@ ely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtu@@ al operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing. 
Mi@@ ros@@ lav Č@@ ep@@ ick@@ ý dra@@ ws attention to potential problems: "@@ The law enab@@ les such specul@@ ation, nevertheless only an in@@ significant percentage of customers use the services of these companies. 
On top of that, they must accept that the SI@@ M card in their telephone is not registered under their name, and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can@@ ." 
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CT@@ O. 
In addition, another question for the OP@@ C aris@@ es. 
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtu@@ al oper@@ ator@@ ? 
It must be added that the OP@@ C has rather considerable power to unc@@ over such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with oper@@ ator@@ s' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it. 
When we won@@ 't be the most expensive 
As mentioned already several times in this ar@@ tic@@ le, the entr@@ ance of the virtu@@ al operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services. 
At the same time, classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtu@@ al operators practically in all countries where they have been created. 
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too satur@@ ated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
But in developed countries, the regulatory organs, which supported the interests not of the mobile oper@@ ators, but of their custom@@ ers, interven@@ ed at that very moment. 
Either through formal measures or inform@@ al pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtu@@ al oper@@ ator, and others continued in its foot@@ step@@ s. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs have been tos@@ sing the whole case back and forth like a hot pot@@ at@@ o. 
Based on our experienc@@ e, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clar@@ ity in compet@@ encies in these cases su@@ its them very well. 
But let@@ 's not throw in the to@@ wel@@ . 
If the behin@@ d-@@ the-@@ scen@@ es information are correct and a virtu@@ al operator appears here soon, the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again. 
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtu@@ al mobile oper@@ ator, it will be difficult for OP@@ C to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (@@ discrimin@@ ation) of further interested parties. 
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
New Czech national anthem has four new ver@@ sions. 
Cho@@ ose the best one 
L@@ ist@@ en to the four ren@@ der@@ ings of the new version of the Czech national an@@ them. 
On Sun@@ day Prime Minister M@@ ire@@ k T@@ opol@@ á@@ ne@@ k presented the new record@@ ings of the national anthem K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j (@@ Where is my Coun@@ tr@@ y) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Stat@@ e@@ hood. 
The anthem was newly recorded by the National The@@ ater Or@@ che@@ stra under the direction of Ji@@ ř@@ í B@@ ě@@ lo@@ h@@ l@@ á@@ ve@@ k. 
Four versions are available - versions with male or female sol@@ o voc@@ als, a ch@@ oral version and an instrum@@ ental ver@@ sion. 
K@@ ate@@ ř@@ ina K@@ n@@ ě@@ ž@@ í@@ n@@ k@@ ov@@ á and A@@ dam Pl@@ ach@@ et@@ ka did the sing@@ ing. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are O@@ tak@@ ar J@@ ere@@ mi@@ á@@ š and J@@ ar@@ os@@ lav Kr@@ č@@ e@@ k. 
You can listen to all four versions on the server i@@ H@@ N@@ ed@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
B@@ ě@@ lo@@ h@@ l@@ á@@ ve@@ k considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national an@@ them@@ s. 
He told Czech Radi@@ o earlier that he had inten@@ tionally selected sing@@ ers with young, representative voices that were striking and popular for the sol@@ o vari@@ ants. 
"@@ From the begin@@ ning, with both of them and also with the ch@@ or@@ us, I tried to make sure that they had clear ar@@ ticul@@ ation, so that the text could be understood well, so that they were in harmon@@ y@@ ,@@ " he said. 
The Czech national anthem will cel@@ eb@@ rate its 17@@ 5@@ th ann@@ iver@@ s@@ ary next year. 
The song K@@ de dom@@ ov m@@ ů@@ j (@@ Where is my Coun@@ tr@@ y) was heard for the first time in 18@@ 34 on the stage of the E@@ states The@@ ater in the original Czech play F@@ id@@ lo@@ va@@ č@@ ka by Jos@@ ef K@@ aj@@ et@@ án T@@ yl with the music of Fr@@ anti@@ š@@ ek Š@@ k@@ rou@@ p. 
It gained popul@@ arity and the people spon@@ taneously took it as their own. 
The first stan@@ za of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem following the creation of Czech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ia in 19@@ 18. 
It remained one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent Czech Republic@@ . 
How the "@@ new@@ " hy@@ m@@ n sounds 
Pr@@ ague City M@@ ass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday 
Wednes@@ day, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Pr@@ ague Transport Company as the date when the first travel@@ lers board the metro@@ , tr@@ ams and buses with an electronic cou@@ p@@ on in their poc@@ kets instead of a paper tic@@ ket. 
The roughly one hundred thousand people in pos@@ session of their own chip card Op@@ enc@@ ard at this time can get this cou@@ p@@ on. 
Tra@@ vel@@ lers can buy a 30-@@ day, 90@@ -day and year-@@ long cou@@ p@@ on (which will be valid beginning on January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at inf@@ o cent@@ ers and bran@@ ches of the Transport Company at the metr@@ o stations M@@ uz@@ e@@ um, M@@ ů@@ ste@@ k, N@@ á@@ dra@@ ž@@ í Ho@@ le@@ š@@ ov@@ ice, And@@ ě@@ l, Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly, Let@@ ň@@ an@@ y, K@@ ob@@ yl@@ is@@ y, Ra@@ j@@ ská za@@ hr@@ ada, Ka@@ č@@ er@@ ov and Luk@@ a. 
B@@ eg@@ in@@ ning yester@@ day, cou@@ p@@ ons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Com@@ pan@@ y, www.@@ d@@ p@@ p.@@ cz@@ . 
By the afterno@@ on, more than four hundred customers had used the service. 
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can defin@@ iti@@ vely forget about the v@@ ending windows in the metr@@ o stations, where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tic@@ ket@@ s. 
That is, they can buy the cou@@ p@@ on over the Internet and it will be added to the Op@@ enc@@ ard at one of the thirteen bran@@ ches of the City Lib@@ r@@ ary. 
"@@ At these loc@@ ations, there is a counter available for travel@@ lers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purch@@ ase, and will also add the purchased cou@@ p@@ on to their card@@ ,@@ " said the projec@@ t's speak@@ er, Martin O@@ pat@@ r@@ n@@ ý@@ . 
In addition to libr@@ aries, it will also be possible to add the electronic cou@@ p@@ ons to the Op@@ enc@@ ard at the self-@@ service machines which have been set up in several ves@@ tib@@ ules of the metro@@ . 
What do these self-@@ service machines look lik@@ e? 
They are red, resemb@@ ling ticket validation machin@@ es, and travel@@ lers might have already noticed them in the metr@@ o stations Ro@@ z@@ ty@@ ly, Bud@@ ě@@ j@@ ov@@ ick@@ á@@ , I. P. P@@ av@@ lov@@ a, Flo@@ ren@@ c and V@@ l@@ ta@@ v@@ sk@@ á@@ . 
"@@ Now there are five of them in the c@@ ity, but by the end of the year there should be eigh@@ ty of them@@ ,@@ " O@@ pat@@ r@@ n@@ ý added. 
Cou@@ p@@ on checked by self-@@ service machine instead of driver 
Using the self-@@ service machin@@ es, which will begin functioning tomor@@ row, is simple. 
All you have to do is insert the Op@@ enc@@ ard chip card, and the pre-@@ paid card is automatically added to it. 
The electronic cou@@ p@@ ons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital c@@ ity, but in its surroun@@ dings as well. 
That is, in sub@@ urban trains and bus lines num@@ be@@ red 300 to 49@@ 9, which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central B@@ oh@@ em@@ ian towns to travel into the capital c@@ ity. 
"@@ In trains included in Pr@@ ague Integr@@ ated Tran@@ spor@@ t, the conduc@@ tors are equipped with card read@@ ers, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the cou@@ pon@@ s@@ ,@@ " F@@ ili@@ p Dr@@ á@@ p@@ al from the organization R@@ op@@ id, which creates the timetables of the Pr@@ ague M@@ ass Tran@@ spor@@ t, explained the tic@@ ket@@ -@@ checking procedures. 
The sub@@ urban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver@@ 's seat. 
Upon board@@ ing, it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the dri@@ ver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Op@@ enc@@ ard on the designated spot on the side of the cash regist@@ er. 
This is how the driver checks the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recorded. 
"@@ If the travel@@ ler needs to confirm the validity of the cou@@ p@@ ons recor@@ ded, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver@@ ,@@ " Dr@@ á@@ p@@ al added. 
Tra@@ vel@@ ers who do not use sub@@ urban bus@@ es, and will not remember when the validity of a cou@@ p@@ on end@@ s, can head again for the self-@@ service machines where the cou@@ p@@ ons are added to the card. 
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the mach@@ ine's scre@@ en. 
Su@@ de@@ ten@@ lands wanted referendum from USA 
Su@@ de@@ ten German@@ s requested that the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region be incorporated into the United States in 19@@ 4@@ 5. 
This is implic@@ it in a letter stored in the collec@@ tions of the South B@@ oh@@ emia Research Lib@@ r@@ ary. 
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we wish at least to live under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the United States. 
Several groups of Su@@ de@@ ten German@@ s supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type@@ . 
This arises fro@@ m, among other things, a letter which has been preserved in a private arch@@ ive and is now stored in the collec@@ tions of the South B@@ oh@@ emia Research Lib@@ r@@ ary. 
In the let@@ ter, German@@ s from Č@@ esk@@ ý K@@ rum@@ lo@@ v request that the American president not to allow the return of the "@@ Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region@@ " - occupied by Hit@@ ler on the basis of the Munich Agre@@ ement - to Czech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ia. 
"@@ We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppres@@ sors and enem@@ ies, but ra@@ ther, as liber@@ ator@@ s@@ ,@@ " is what is written in the let@@ ter, signed "@@ People who are not indifferent to the fate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va@@ ". 
Since the annex@@ ation by Czech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ia supposedly only gives the Su@@ de@@ ten German@@ s hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brut@@ ality, dis@@ regar@@ d, lack of understand@@ ing, oppression and sla@@ very, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protec@@ torate of Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va forever. 
"@@ We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would aw@@ ard this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppres@@ ses and op@@ pu@@ gn@@ s minor@@ ities and which has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Al@@ li@@ es@@ ,@@ " is written in the let@@ ter. 
The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of reven@@ ge by the "@@ Czech oppres@@ sor@@ s@@ ". 
If the president of the USA were to supposedly have doubts about the persu@@ as@@ ion of the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va German@@ s, it would be enough to organ@@ ize a referendum in the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va region on whether its inhabitants want to become a part of the USA or live under the pat@@ ron@@ age of the United States. 
Th@@ ough the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve given the contem@@ por@@ ary knowledge of post-@@ war history, according to some witness@@ es it appropriately sk@@ et@@ ches the expectations of the Su@@ de@@ ten German@@ s at that time. 
Even though the Czech German@@ s had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discus@@ sed, almost none of them admitted this possibility at all. 
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a certain type of autonom@@ y for the Su@@ de@@ ten@@ lands. 
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ia. 
The famous journalist G@@ ust@@ a@@ v Ch@@ alu@@ pa@@ , born in Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ j@@ ov@@ ice, also confirms this. 
As a German from Č@@ esk@@ é Bud@@ ě@@ j@@ ov@@ ice, he was sent to the n@@ av@@ y in the Baltic Se@@ a during the war. 
When he was cap@@ tured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Hol@@ ste@@ in, tens of other Czech German@@ s went to him so that he would teach them Czech@@ . 
"@@ They believed that when they returned home, Czech would come in hand@@ y@@ ,@@ " Ch@@ alu@@ pa said. 
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czech@@ os@@ lov@@ ak@@ ia before the war envisaged being displaced from the re@@ public on the basis of the Bene@@ š Decre@@ es. 
You don't think - you pay@@ ! 
E@@ mo@@ tive campaign attacks drivers 
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history. 
Th@@ at@@ 's also one way to character@@ ize the emo@@ tive media campaign which the Ministry of Tran@@ sport@@ ation plans to launch on Wednes@@ day. 
The office of minister A@@ le@@ š Ř@@ eb@@ í@@ č@@ ek hopes that it will discour@@ age drivers from be@@ having danger@@ ously behind the whe@@ el. 
The 150@@ -@@ milli@@ on-@@ cro@@ wn campaign will appear on televis@@ ion, on the radi@@ o, in c@@ inem@@ as, on the Internet, but also on fl@@ y@@ ers. 
It should discour@@ age drivers from spe@@ eding and driving under the influence of alcohol. 
And also remind them to fast@@ en their seat@@ belts before they start dri@@ ving. 
A@@ bo@@ ve all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young driver@@ s, motor@@ cyc@@ list@@ s, pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans, and last but not least, professional driver@@ s. 
And what appears in the spot@@ s? 
Main@@ ly human stories that attack the emo@@ tions. 
And even the "@@ blood@@ y@@ " slogan of the whole campaign at@@ tests to this: 
You don't think - you pay@@ ! 
The words "@@ you don't think@@ " are written in capital letters on a licen@@ se pl@@ ate. 
And then the words "@@ you pay@@ " are in a pool of blood. 
This is meant to symbol@@ ize that a person can pay for a moment of ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ness with his/her own life. 
The spots will "@@ ha@@ unt@@ " the view@@ ers until 2010. 
The mini@@ stry found inspir@@ ation in similar campaigns in An@@ glo@@ -@@ S@@ ax@@ on countries, where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims. 
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decreas@@ e. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro R@@ SC@@ G. 
Sugar and wh@@ i@@ p for drivers 
"@@ The drivers are influenced by the sugar and wh@@ i@@ p system. 
The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time. 
The wh@@ i@@ p is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk@@ ,@@ " says Martin K@@ o@@ ř@@ á@@ n, a transportation psych@@ ologist from N@@ a Hom@@ ol@@ ce Hospit@@ al. 
And that@@ 's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psych@@ ologist believ@@ es. 
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the driver@@ s' attention to the dang@@ er. 
"@@ If a static table which warn@@ s against danger is inst@@ al@@ led, it will likely soon bl@@ end in with the surroun@@ dings and the drivers will not pay attention to it@@ ,@@ " K@@ o@@ ř@@ án warn@@ ed. 
Ol@@ m@@ ert would return nearly all occupied territ@@ ories in exchange for peace 
The prime minister of the provisional Israeli government, E@@ hu@@ d Ol@@ mer@@ t, expressed his opinion in favour of the re@@ stitution of practically all territ@@ ories occupied in 19@@ 6@@ 7, that is, even Trans@@ j@@ ord@@ an, East Jerusal@@ em and the G@@ olan He@@ igh@@ ts, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Sy@@ ria. 
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Y@@ edi@@ oth Ah@@ ron@@ oth on Mon@@ day. 
"@@ We must reach an agreement with the Palestini@@ ans, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the (@@ occup@@ i@@ ed) territor@@ ies, if not all of them@@ ,@@ " Ol@@ m@@ ert told the newspap@@ er. 
"@@ We will keep a certain percentage of these territor@@ ies, but we will have to c@@ ede a similar percentage (@@ of Israeli territor@@ y) to the Palestini@@ ans, because there will be no peace if we don't do that@@ ,@@ " he added. 
He admitted that the possible re@@ stitution would also include East Jerusal@@ em. 
"@@ Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusal@@ em and above all does not want tractors or bull@@ doz@@ ers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friend@@ s, will have to give up a part of Jerusal@@ em@@ ,@@ " Ol@@ m@@ ert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in Jul@@ y, during which several people were killed and tens injured. 
According to the prime mini@@ ster, it will be necessary to find a "@@ special solution for the T@@ emp@@ le M@@ oun@@ t, a sacred and historic place@@ ", which lies inside the O@@ ld C@@ ity. 
"@@ Whoever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 27@@ 0@@ ,000 Arab@@ s. 
That won@@ 't work@@ ,@@ " he stressed further. 
Le@@ aving G@@ olan He@@ ights 
Ol@@ m@@ ert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the G@@ olan He@@ igh@@ ts, which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Sy@@ ria. 
But that would also require certain effort from Damasc@@ us. 
"@@ I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the G@@ olan He@@ igh@@ ts@@ ,@@ " he warn@@ ed. 
"@@ The Sy@@ ri@@ ans know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the G@@ olan He@@ igh@@ ts. 
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran@@ ; they will have to give up their relationship to the (S@@ hi@@ -@@ ite mov@@ ement@@ ) He@@ z@@ bol@@ la@@ h@@ ; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the (S@@ hi@@ -@@ ite mov@@ ement@@ ) Ham@@ as, (the terrorist net@@ work@@ ) Al-@@ Q@@ a@@ eda and the j@@ i@@ had (@@ hol@@ y war@@ ) in Iraq@@ ,@@ " the prime minister specified. 
Questions after accid@@ ent: Are ste@@ wards in the bus illeg@@ al? 
Law does@@ n't know them, walking in coach bus not permitted 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Stud@@ ent Agency near Pa@@ du@@ a, Italy, the question has aris@@ en as to whether ste@@ wards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion. 
"@@ If we would like to strictly and formally uph@@ old the law, the activities of the ste@@ ward are in conflict with the Tra@@ ffic Law@@ ,@@ " says speaker for the Ministry of Tran@@ sport@@ ation Kare@@ l H@@ anz@@ el@@ k@@ a. 
The accident, during which a twenty-@@ two-@@ year-old ste@@ ward@@ ess died last week, was evidently caused by the driver of the tr@@ uck that crossed into the path of the bus@@ . 
Un@@ luc@@ kil@@ y, at that moment, the girl was sitting next to the dri@@ ver, in the least safe place in the vehicle, even though there are two more seats reserved for h@@ er. 
However, the bus can cr@@ ash or brake shar@@ ply even when the ste@@ ward is hand@@ ing out coffee or newspap@@ ers. 
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role. 
If this is not approved in the b@@ us, the passengers must sit@@ . 
The Stud@@ ent Agency coach buses do not have standing room@@ ; which the head of the company, Radi@@ m J@@ an@@ č@@ ur@@ a, also confirmed for A@@ k@@ tu@@ á@@ l@@ n@@ ě@@ .@@ cz@@ . 
"@@ We tried to find a solution to this with the mini@@ str@@ y, and initially they did not permit the movement of the passeng@@ ers. 
E@@ vent@@ ually they re@@ v@@ oked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat@@ ,@@ " he con@@ ve@@ yed his position. 
The law does not know the ste@@ ward 
"@@ There is no stra@@ ight@@ forward legal interpretation of the ste@@ ward - no legal en@@ act@@ ments deal with this role. 
However, nor do any legal en@@ act@@ ments prohibit the transporters from providing services. 
The Tra@@ ffic Law only knows the term vehicle conduc@@ tor@@ ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person@@ ,@@ " speaker H@@ anz@@ el@@ ka added less un@@ ambigu@@ ously. 
The head of the Department of M@@ otor Vehic@@ le Operation of the Ministry of Tran@@ sport@@ ation, Jos@@ ef P@@ ok@@ or@@ n@@ ý@@ , on the contrary, said that the law treats this issue sufficiently. 
"@@ It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certific@@ ation. 
Th@@ at@@ 's all there is to it@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ ys. 
B@@ uses are divided into the categories of city b@@ us, where there is standing room and limited maximum spe@@ ed, inter-@@ city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permit@@ ted, and coach bus@@ es, with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat bel@@ ts. 
Like in an air@@ plan@@ e, says expert 
J@@ ar@@ os@@ lav Ho@@ ř@@ í@@ n, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strateg@@ y for Tra@@ ffic Safety (@@ BE@@ SI@@ P@@ ), does not see any essential problem in the movement of ste@@ wards on the bus@@ es. 
"@@ During a smooth ride, there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in air@@ plan@@ es. 
Even there it is not certain when tur@@ bul@@ ence will occur and the ste@@ ward@@ ess can hit her head@@ ." 
"@@ However, if the bus were to brake shar@@ pl@@ y, of course, the laws of phys@@ ics are val@@ id. 
Just like in a city bus or a tr@@ am. 
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the ste@@ wards through internal regul@@ ation@@ s@@ ,@@ " he says, and he also thinks that from the legal perspec@@ tive, this issue is un@@ resolved. 
J@@ an@@ č@@ ura willing to discontinue services 
Stud@@ ent Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the ste@@ ward service. 
It emplo@@ ys nearly two hundred of them. 
Even after the accident, the head does not consider their job to be risk@@ y. 
"@@ But as soon as I gain the impression that the ste@@ ward@@ s' job is risk@@ y, I will discontinue them. 
P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers can get coffee and newspapers when board@@ ing. 
It would also save cost@@ s@@ ,@@ " he sa@@ ys. 
Alex@@ ej L@@ it@@ v@@ in, head of Asi@@ ana, which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does, explained the absence of ste@@ wards in his vehicles as due to safety interest@@ s. 
"@@ We don't have ste@@ ward@@ ess@@ es, we@@ '@@ ve been against it from the very beginning. 
So@@ on@@ er or later it will end in a fatal accid@@ ent@@ ,@@ " he told T@@ ý@@ den@@ .@@ c@@ z nearly a year ago. 
E@@ norm@@ ous tragedy occurred 
A young ste@@ ward@@ ess from the P@@ il@@ sen area, who had worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on the bus line to Nap@@ les. 
A Sloven@@ ian tractor tr@@ ail@@ er tr@@ uck likely left the emergency lan@@ e without sign@@ alling and blocked the path of the bus@@ . 
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeuv@@ re, however, the front right part of the bus gra@@ zed it. 
J@@ an@@ č@@ ura re@@ buff@@ s the claim that the two seats reserved for the ste@@ ward@@ s' rest had been sold out. 
"@@ It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach bus@@ es, they are block@@ ed@@ ." 
The company plans to su@@ e the driver of the truc@@ k. 
The agency will not wait for the court verdic@@ t to compensate the gir@@ l@@ 's family, but it expec@@ ts financial compensation from the guilty party. 
Ad@@ ap@@ tation of the law@@ ? 
Far away 
An adaptation of the law, on which a thirty-@@ member expert group from the Ministry of Tran@@ sport@@ ation has been working for over a year, could bring about the specification of the movement of ste@@ wards on board the bus@@ es. 
"@@ But no concrete conclusion has been reached. 
They are not dealing with buses much, it is more the point system, the maximum speed on the high@@ way and the use of cell ph@@ ones while dri@@ v@@ ing@@ ,@@ " says expert Ho@@ ř@@ í@@ n. 
"@@ The Ministry of Tran@@ sport@@ ation does not consider the activity of the ste@@ wards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential wa@@ y@@ ,@@ " con@@ cludes speaker H@@ anz@@ el@@ ka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the juris@@ dic@@ tion of the police and the Lab@@ or Safety Offic@@ e. 
Du@@ ess@@ el@@ dor@@ f Hop@@ es R@@ est in Frankfurt 
In a letter from the West@@ L@@ B board of direc@@ tors to the bank@@ 's employees, grand talk is not in short supply. 
Combin@@ ing units of the Du@@ ess@@ el@@ dor@@ f institution with Frankfur@@ t's De@@ ka Ban@@ k, the notice made public on Monday claim@@ s, could `@@ create a major capit@@ al-@@ market institution of the Spar@@ k@@ ass@@ en Fin@@ anz@@ g@@ rup@@ pe@@ .' 
West@@ L@@ B would contribute to the deal a `@@ blo@@ c of experti@@ se@@ ' with sustained ear@@ ning power, it sa@@ ys. 
Generally, the letter suggest@@ s, this kind of join@@ ter might provide the pivotal impul@@ se for further concentration in the area of the German state ban@@ ks, the Land@@ es@@ bank@@ en. 
Th@@ at@@ 's what it sounds like when a board of direc@@ tors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times. 
The fl@@ agging West@@ L@@ B is still exposed to tremendous pressure, after all. 
Not just from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Super@@ vision, which only recently warned the state government of North Rh@@ ine-@@ West@@ phal@@ ia that there was an urgent need for a solution. 
But talks of some type of join@@ ter between De@@ ka Ban@@ k, which savings bank cli@@ ents are familiar with due to its investment fun@@ ds, and West@@ L@@ B have been making the roun@@ ds for some time now - even in Frankfur@@ t. 
Pres@@ ent@@ ing the report on the first two quarters in late August, De@@ ka Bank head Fran@@ z Wa@@ as said a fusion between the institute on Main@@ zer Land@@ strasse and a Land@@ es@@ ban@@ k, such as H@@ es@@ se and Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ia@@ 's Hel@@ ab@@ a or West@@ L@@ B, made little sense to him. 
But the administrative board of De@@ ka, which is owned in equal parts by the Land@@ es@@ ban@@ ken and the savings banks associ@@ ations, has asked the board of direc@@ tors to comm@@ ence talks with West@@ L@@ B on joint business vent@@ ures. 
The possible subject is the capit@@ al-@@ market bus@@ iness, or parts of it. 
Of course, as sources in the financial community point out, negotiations have only just beg@@ un. 
I@@ t's not the first time that the name De@@ ka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial cent@@ er of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolid@@ ation. 
In 2003, a merger of De@@ ka Bank with Land@@ es@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate and Hel@@ ab@@ a briefly seemed to be within the real@@ m of possib@@ ility. 
But in the end, the thre@@ es@@ ome did@@ n't happen. 
As soon as the plans became public, the H@@ es@@ si@@ an state government spoke out against the participation of Hel@@ ab@@ a. 
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement. 
Instead, Land@@ es@@ bank R@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ atin@@ ate was bought by St@@ ut@@ tg@@ art@@ 's Land@@ es@@ bank Baden@@ -@@ W@@ u@@ er@@ tt@@ emb@@ erg@@ . 
But deliber@@ ations on a join@@ ter between De@@ ka Bank and Land@@ es@@ ban@@ ken have continued to rear their head@@ s. 
Most recently, Gu@@ en@@ ther Mer@@ l, chairman of the board at Hel@@ ab@@ a, had qu@@ elled considerations of a merger with his institu@@ tion. 
This as@@ ide, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolid@@ ation of the various institutions in the public sector is imper@@ ative. 
First up, now that the state elections in Bav@@ aria are over, a join@@ ter between Bay@@ er@@ n@@ L@@ B and the Land@@ es@@ bank Baden@@ -@@ W@@ u@@ er@@ tt@@ emb@@ er@@ g may have become more likely. 
For Hel@@ ab@@ a, that@@ 's not necessarily good new@@ s. 
Should the pressure for more merg@@ ers increase, it will by degrees be running out of potential part@@ ners. 
In the Sou@@ th, it would merely be a j@@ uni@@ or part@@ ner, although it has to date wea@@ thered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and St@@ ut@@ t@@ gar@@ t. 
A merger with West@@ L@@ B, in turn, was squ@@ as@@ hed early this year by the Sav@@ ings Bank Association of H@@ es@@ se and Th@@ ur@@ ing@@ ia, which own@@ s 85 percent of Hel@@ ab@@ a. 
Rem@@ ain@@ s only Nord@@ L@@ B. 
But such ge@@ o@@ strategic considerations are only one side of the equ@@ ation. 
On the other stands the question in how far the institution@@ s' different business models are compatible with another. 
In June, Mer@@ l said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustain@@ ability of the Land@@ es@@ ban@@ ken had not yet been resolved by the German Sav@@ ings Bank Associ@@ ation. 
Ul@@ tim@@ ately, West@@ L@@ B might also be split up, al@@ though, of course, that@@ 's not a solution fav@@ o@@ red at West@@ L@@ B. 
The letter from its board of director@@ s, accord@@ ingly, voices the manifest desire for a `@@ comprehensive solution@@ .' 
Quite how this is reconc@@ il@@ able with a join@@ ter between individual units of West@@ L@@ B and De@@ ka Bank remains to be se@@ en.

They have been making tri@@ ps to the O@@ k@@ tob@@ er@@ f@@ est for five years now, three of them this year alone.
