R@@ igh@@ t-@@ wing popul@@ ists trium@@ p@@ h in Austria, have total of 29 percent 
According to the first preliminary results of the early parliam@@ ent elec@@ tions in Austria have brought about a percep@@ ti@@ ble weak@@ ening of both parties in the present large co@@ al@@ ition and a significant bo@@ ost for the righ@@ t-@@ wing popul@@ ist parti@@ es. 
The Austrian Peop@@ le@@ 's Party (@@ Ö@@ V@@ P@@ ), where the position of the current head@@ , Wil@@ hel@@ m Mol@@ te@@ rer@@ , is being severely j@@ ol@@ ted, suffered particularly great los@@ ses. 
Con@@ ver@@ sel@@ y, the campa@@ ign leader of the Al@@ li@@ ance for the F@@ ut@@ ure of Austria (B@@ Z@@ Ö@@ ), Car@@ in@@ thi@@ an Gover@@ nor J@@ ö@@ r@@ g Ha@@ id@@ er, is preparing a trium@@ ph@@ ant return to national poli@@ tics. 
According to the preliminary results, the S@@ ocial Dem@@ ocr@@ atic Party (@@ SP@@ Ö@@ ) remains the strong@@ est in the country with 29@@ .@@ 8 percent of vot@@ es, however, it has lost 5.@@ 5 percent of votes since the last elec@@ tions in 2006. 
Ö@@ V@@ P, which with its 2@@ 5.@@ 6 percent los@@ es nearly nine percent of vot@@ es, fa@@ red even wor@@ se. 
These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-@@ war history, and particularly for the Peop@@ le@@ 's Par@@ ty, who urg@@ ed the early elec@@ tions, it is liter@@ ally a catastroph@@ ic resul@@ t. 
At the beginning of Jul@@ y, when Ö@@ V@@ P left the co@@ ali@@ tion, the Peop@@ le@@ 's Party still had a significant lead on SP@@ Ö in the poll@@ s. 
V@@ o@@ ters, however, apparently pun@@ ished them for le@@ tting the government fl@@ oun@@ der. 
In the first reactions to the results, there were already specul@@ ations about the possible resign@@ ation of the party head and current vic@@ e-@@ ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Wil@@ hel@@ m Mol@@ te@@ re@@ r. 
Ob@@ ser@@ vers anticip@@ ate that this could take place as early as at the ex@@ traordinary meeting of the party lead@@ ership on Mon@@ day. 
Such a development would certainly simp@@ lif@@ y the journe@@ y to@@ ward the increasingly most likely rec@@ our@@ se from the election results, that is, the renew@@ al of the large co@@ al@@ ition of SP@@ Ö and Ö@@ V@@ P. 
G@@ iv@@ en the strength@@ ening of both righ@@ t-@@ wing popul@@ ist parties - the Fre@@ ed@@ om Party (F@@ P@@ Ö@@ ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and B@@ Z@@ Ö el@@ even percent of the votes - however, at the same time, the S@@ ocial Dem@@ oc@@ rats expres@@ sed fear of a repe@@ ti@@ tion of the year 199@@ 9, when the Peop@@ le@@ 's Party agreed with the popul@@ ists (F@@ P@@ Ö was still un@@ ited at that time, it bro@@ ke away from B@@ Z@@ Ö in 200@@ 5) on a common govern@@ ment, which event@@ ually prov@@ oked sanc@@ tions from the European Union. 
Ha@@ id@@ er, who has already announc@@ ed that he is prepared to work together with any party and pre@@ sum@@ es he will return to Vien@@ na to national poli@@ tics, is evid@@ ently ban@@ king on this development. 
The Green Party also got into the parliam@@ ent, but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parti@@ es. 
E@@ vid@@ ently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliam@@ ent. 
Sch@@ war@@ z@@ en@@ b@@ erg@@ : Rel@@ ations with India could wor@@ sen 
According to F@@ ore@@ ign Minister K@@ are@@ l Sch@@ war@@ z@@ en@@ b@@ erg@@ , if it will not be possible to solve the problem of the Czech scientists charg@@ ed in India with the illegal collection of be@@ et@@ les, a certain worsening of Cz@@ ech@@ -@@ Indi@@ an relations could take place. 
The mini@@ ster made this statement in New Yor@@ k following to@@ day@@ 's meeting with his Indi@@ an counter@@ part, P@@ ran@@ ab M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e. 
"@@ If it is not solv@@ ed, then y@@ es, then a certain worsening would take place@@ ,@@ " he states following the meeting initiated from the Czech side. 
Following the negoti@@ ations, M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e said that it was difficult for the execu@@ tive b@@ ran@@ ch to interven@@ e in judic@@ ial mat@@ ters. 
Nevertheless, he said that in the case of Pet@@ r Š@@ v@@ á@@ cha@@ , who was cleared of the charges and pen@@ alized with a fin@@ e, the central government can negoti@@ ate with the local government in Dar@@ je@@ el@@ ing, under the j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tion of which the matter belong@@ s. 
"@@ His problem could be solv@@ ed@@ ,@@ " the mini@@ ster said. 
According to M@@ uk@@ her@@ je@@ e, it would be best for Em@@ il Ku@@ č@@ er@@ a, sentenced to three years in pris@@ on, to appeal to higher authorities. 
He can then request to be released on ba@@ il and wait for the ver@@ dic@@ t outside of j@@ ail@@ , he explain@@ ed. 
Sch@@ war@@ z@@ en@@ berg confirmed that his part@@ ner had also said this during the negoti@@ ations. 
"@@ He recommend@@ s appe@@ aling to a higher cour@@ t, then it would be possible to par@@ don him@@ ,@@ " the head of Czech dipl@@ om@@ acy said. 
The only way the Czech side can become involved in the whole matter is to provide the sentenced individuals with "@@ competent legal support@@ "@@ , the Indi@@ an mini@@ ster said. 
At the same time, he said that the Indi@@ an side is already also providing them with aid of this type@@ . 
"@@ It is in our greatest interest to maintain the best relations with Indi@@ a, which have a long-@@ standing tradi@@ tion. 
The Indi@@ ans also ac@@ knowledge this@@ ,@@ " Sch@@ war@@ z@@ en@@ berg said. 
At the same time, as he told the Czech P@@ ress ag@@ ency, he emphas@@ ized in front of his part@@ ner that the Czech Republic placed great importance on the problem of the Czech ent@@ om@@ olog@@ ists. 
"@@ We tr@@ uly consider the ar@@ rest and charg@@ ing of these Czech scientists to be a gra@@ ve mistak@@ e@@ ,@@ " he decl@@ are@@ d. 
The mini@@ ster avoided answ@@ ering the question of whether he had received a promis@@ e from the Indi@@ an side to pursu@@ e the matter. 
He stated merely "@@ I have already received quite a few promis@@ es@@ ". 
Czech refe@@ re@@ es batt@@ le for oc@@ ean floor 
He steps to@@ ward the electronic wall ma@@ p de@@ pic@@ ting Au@@ str@@ alia and the surrounding sea areas. 
However, he is not interested in the contin@@ ent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the oc@@ e@@ an. 
"@@ This is@@ land, and with it the oc@@ ean floor surrounding it, belongs to Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia. 
At the same time, the area is as large as the contin@@ ent itsel@@ f@@ ,@@ " says Italian lawy@@ er Lu@@ ig@@ i San@@ to@@ su@@ os@@ so, who belongs to the thir@@ ty-@@ member team of employees of the UN D@@ iv@@ ision for O@@ ce@@ an A@@ ff@@ air@@ s and the La@@ w of the Se@@ a. 
His bos@@ s, the division director@@ , Czech lawy@@ er V@@ á@@ cl@@ a@@ v M@@ ik@@ ul@@ k@@ a, follow@@ s what he is saying and occasionally ad@@ ds some@@ thing. 
Z@@ est and enthusias@@ m for work are domin@@ ant here. 
The oc@@ ean floor shel@@ ters a thus far little known world rich in natural resourc@@ es. 
It is possible to find oil, ore@@ s, and other miner@@ als, but also thus far unknown living organis@@ ms that hold the ke@@ y, for example, to the development of a cure for cancer. 
A floor larger than the contin@@ ent 
Co@@ ast@@ al countries today have begun to ve@@ hem@@ ently compe@@ te for the new under@@ water territor@@ y. 
That is, according to a UN agreement they are u@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ing the rights on which they agreed in 198@@ 2 in Mon@@ te@@ go Ba@@ y, J@@ am@@ a@@ ic@@ a. 
This is mainly the area of the so-called contin@@ ental shel@@ f, which often reaches up to several hundred kilome@@ ters from the coast of the given country. 
According to the agre@@ ement, that country has the exclus@@ ive right to all resources of the contin@@ ental shel@@ f. 
"@@ T@@ ak@@ en simpl@@ y, the contin@@ ental shel@@ f is considered to be the part of the oc@@ ean floor which is the natural continuation of the contin@@ ent under the sea and its substr@@ at@@ um. 
It reached beyond the ed@@ ge of the coast@@ al se@@ a, often even beyond the ed@@ ge of the two hundred na@@ u@@ tical mil@@ es of the so-called exclus@@ ive economic z@@ one@@ "@@ , M@@ ik@@ ul@@ ka explain@@ s. 
The request the given country sub@@ mits to the Commission on the Lim@@ its of the Con@@ tin@@ ental Shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation based on many cost@@ ly surveys and measure@@ ments. 
It is the result of many years of prepar@@ atory work. 
"@@ One of our ro@@ les is to provide the commis@@ sion with legal and speci@@ alized technical assistance. 
The commis@@ sion has thus far discussed five request@@ s, from Russi@@ a, Braz@@ il, Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia, Ireland and New Ze@@ al@@ and. 
Only the last three of those countries have been successful so far@@ ,@@ " M@@ ik@@ ul@@ ka add@@ s. 
Rec@@ ently the success of Au@@ str@@ al@@ ia, which was the first to exp@@ and its under@@ water dom@@ ain, was registered world@@ w@@ ide. 
But New Ze@@ al@@ and gained as well - the area of the oc@@ ean floor that the commis@@ sion conc@@ eded to it is around 1.@@ 6 million square kilome@@ ters, that is, roughly six times big@@ ger than the size of the country itsel@@ f. 
Both countries invest@@ ed millions of dol@@ lar@@ s into surve@@ ying. 
The prof@@ it which will ensu@@ e from the u@@ ti@@ li@@ zation of the oc@@ ean floor in the future will be, they hop@@ e, pric@@ el@@ ess. 
Other countries will also gradually sub@@ mit their request@@ s. 
They have until ten years from the moment when they rati@@ fied the "@@ Mon@@ te@@ go B@@ ay A@@ gre@@ ement@@ " to do so. 
Where the contin@@ ental shel@@ f end@@ s, the area of the oc@@ ean floor declared by the agreement as the "@@ common her@@ it@@ age of human@@ kin@@ d@@ " begin@@ s. 
H@@ ere no country has any exclus@@ ive position any long@@ er. 
Min@@ ing rights in this area are granted through the agreement established by the international institu@@ tion. 
"@@ But the oc@@ ean floor is no K@@ lon@@ di@@ ke@@ "@@ , director M@@ ik@@ ul@@ ka says exagg@@ er@@ ated@@ ly, adding that his "@@ individual areas are legally clearly del@@ im@@ ited and their regime is an@@ cho@@ red in contract@@ s.@@ " 
Cz@@ ech@@ s in the Pac@@ ific 
Part of the oc@@ ean floor currently belongs to the Czech Republic@@ . 
It sha@@ res it with other countries from the former E@@ astern Blo@@ c as a part of the common organ@@ ization "@@ Inter@@ oc@@ e@@ an@@ metal@@ ". 
By agre@@ ement, this organiz@@ ation, like the invest@@ ors of several small other countries, gained the status of so-called "@@ p@@ ion@@ e@@ ering in@@ ve@@ stor@@ " in 199@@ 1. 
It is author@@ ized to mine in the C@@ lar@@ ion@@ C@@ lip@@ per@@ ton zone in the Pac@@ ific O@@ ce@@ an, which lies between Mex@@ ic@@ o, H@@ awa@@ i@@ i and K@@ i@@ rib@@ ati@@ . 
The area investigated by the invest@@ or is slightly larger than the former Cz@@ ech@@ os@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia. 
The oc@@ ean floor there is ru@@ g@@ g@@ ed, it is a sort of under@@ water model of the T@@ at@@ ra M@@ oun@@ tain@@ s. 
"@@ It is possible to mine there on an overall area of 75@@ ,000 square kilome@@ ters. 
The area is a rich lo@@ cal@@ ity for the collection of pol@@ y-@@ metal concre@@ tions containing nick@@ el, cop@@ per@@ , c@@ obal@@ t and m@@ ang@@ an@@ es@@ e@@ ,@@ " says another lawy@@ er, Pak@@ sh@@ i Ra@@ j@@ an from Indi@@ a. 
The Mac@@ ed@@ on@@ ian lawy@@ er from the di@@ vision, Rob@@ er San@@ de@@ v@@ , b@@ rings one such concre@@ tion to demonstr@@ ate. 
It looks like a small pot@@ at@@ o or, with a bit of f@@ ant@@ as@@ y, the my@@ th@@ ical sh@@ em@@ , which, according to leg@@ end, brought the G@@ ole@@ m to life. 
German Special For@@ c@@ es Pres@@ ent at Ho@@ stage Res@@ c@@ ue

The German forces were not required, however, they said, because the cap@@ tors abandon@@ ed their ho@@ stages and fl@@ ed when they became aware that the ho@@ stages were about to be fre@@ ed by forc@@ e. 
The Egyp@@ ti@@ an government had accepted the help offered by Germany to rely on the German forces as back@@ up during the operation. 
`@@ Luc@@ kil@@ y, it did@@ n't come to that@@ ,@@ ' a spok@@ es@@ man of the German Fed@@ eral Ministry of the Inter@@ ior said. 
The travel group consist@@ ing of five German@@ s, five Ital@@ i@@ ans, a Romani@@ an woman and their eight Egyp@@ ti@@ an compan@@ ions had been am@@ bus@@ hed and abduc@@ ted on September 19 in the sou@@ th of Egyp@@ t. 
After their abduc@@ tion in a des@@ ert region in the sou@@ th of Egyp@@ t, the ho@@ stages had been carried back and for@@ th in the border region between Egyp@@ t, L@@ ib@@ y@@ a, Sud@@ an and Cha@@ d. 
To date, the identity of the cap@@ tors remains unknown, as do details on the resc@@ ue or on possible ran@@ som@@ s. 
The former ho@@ stages have arri@@ ved safely and s@@ ound@@ ly in Ca@@ iro@@ , mean@@ whil@@ e.

In Ber@@ l@@ in, no immediate information on their return to Germany was given. 
According to German newspaper `@@ B@@ ild@@ ,@@ ' the five tou@@ rists and the special forces are to board an Air@@ bus of the German Air For@@ c@@ e, which is said to arrive in Germany on Tues@@ day.

With a vote of 2@@ 27 to 20@@ 6 again@@ st, the U@@ .@@ S. House of Re@@ present@@ atives rejec@@ ted the govern@@ ment@@ 's b@@ ail@@ out package for the financial market@@ s. 
All appe@@ als by President Ge@@ orge W@@ . B@@ ush and leading officials of both parties not@@ with@@ stand@@ ing, no majority was reached for the program that was meant to contain the cha@@ os at the financial market@@ s.

`@@ I@@ t's hard to get political approval for the prevention of something that hasn't happened y@@ et@@ ,@@ ' he conce@@ ded. 
While the vote was still under@@ way, the Do@@ w J@@ ones saw a drop of more than six percent@@ , or 600 points.

It recovered shor@@ tly before the end of the vot@@ e, only to take another no@@ se@@ -@@ di@@ ve when the rejection was made public.

Tra@@ vel Ag@@ encies Report Increase in Bo@@ ok@@ ings 
I@@ t's going to be a good win@@ ter for German travel ag@@ encies, evid@@ ent@@ ly: 
A survey says that the tur@@ no@@ ver of book@@ ings for the coming months has increased significantly versus the previous year - for the win@@ ter seas@@ on by as much as 30 percent@@ , ev@@ en. 
Despite prospec@@ ts of a weak econom@@ y, the German@@ s' appetite for travelling remains un@@ spo@@ il@@ ed, a survey sa@@ ys. 
For book@@ ings during the win@@ ter seas@@ on, travel agencies saw an increase in tur@@ no@@ ver of 31 percent versus the same period of the previous year, the German Tra@@ vel Association (D@@ R@@ V) reported in Berlin on Mon@@ day. 
According to market research firm G@@ f@@ K@@ , there has been an increase in book@@ ings during the autum@@ n months as well. 
Tra@@ vel agencies had seen an increase in tur@@ no@@ ver of approximately el@@ even percent for October versus 2007, the DR@@ V said. 
The results are based on the figures of G@@ f@@ K@@ , which processes the bo@@ oking data of 12@@ 00 German travel agencies every month and uses them to make projec@@ tions for the market as a who@@ le. 
In@@ cluded are travel book@@ ings made through August 2008. 
Due to a weak dol@@ l@@ ar, especially tri@@ ps to the United States were in dem@@ and, the DR@@ V said. 
In this area, book@@ ings had increased by approximately one thir@@ d, it said. 
That as@@ ide, it pointed out Spain, Turkey and Greece as being pop@@ ular among German@@ s, as well as domestic reg@@ ions. 
All@@ -@@ in@@ clus@@ ive tri@@ ps were especially s@@ ough@@ t-@@ af@@ ter, DR@@ V President K@@ la@@ us La@@ ep@@ ple said.

Con@@ sum@@ ers could save money through ear@@ ly-@@ bir@@ d or all-@@ in@@ clus@@ ive dis@@ counts, among others, La@@ ep@@ ple said.

Turk@@ ey@@ 's wid@@ ening dipl@@ om@@ atic horiz@@ ons 
Long before Turkey sought to jo@@ in the European Union, the European powers were e@@ ag@@ er to penetrate deep into Turk@@ ey@@ 's h@@ inter@@ land. 
On the e@@ astern side of the B@@ osph@@ or@@ us, maybe just 20 steps into A@@ sia, stands one of the fin@@ est rel@@ ics of this failed im@@ peri@@ al ambi@@ tion. 
Hy@@ dar@@ p@@ ash@@ a rail@@ way st@@ ation was designed by two German architec@@ ts O@@ t@@ to Rit@@ ter and Hel@@ m@@ ut Con@@ u in the ne@@ o-@@ ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance sty@@ le. 
That at least is what the gu@@ ide@@ bo@@ oks tell you. 
The building s@@ its ast@@ ride the end of the plat@@ forms with a to@@ wer at each of its front cor@@ ners looking for all the world like some prov@@ in@@ cial German town h@@ all. 
The stone is di@@ r@@ ty. 
The whole edi@@ f@@ ice slightly dec@@ ay@@ ing. 
But once inside the va@@ ul@@ ted tic@@ ket offic@@ e, there is no doub@@ ting the gran@@ de@@ ur of the enterpris@@ e of which this was the we@@ ster@@ n@@ most g@@ ate@@ way. 
The st@@ ation was opened in August 19@@ 0@@ 8 by a German con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um, the An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia@@ -B@@ ag@@ h@@ da@@ d Corpor@@ ation. 
Germany, a lat@@ ec@@ om@@ er to the im@@ peri@@ al ga@@ me, intended to re@@ alise its ambi@@ tions to domin@@ ate the Mid@@ dle East by means of this rail@@ way running to Dam@@ asc@@ us, B@@ ag@@ h@@ d@@ ad, and beyond into what today is Sa@@ ud@@ i Ar@@ ab@@ ia. 
But German@@ y's im@@ peri@@ al ambi@@ tions foun@@ dered during the World W@@ ar I. 
Its rail@@ way trac@@ ks were attacked by L@@ aw@@ rence of Ar@@ ab@@ ia and his A@@ ra@@ b irregular@@ s. 
The relative isol@@ ation from its surrounding region, en@@ gen@@ dered by the frozen b@@ ound@@ aries of the C@@ old W@@ ar, has gone 
British and domin@@ ion forces advanced out of Egyp@@ t and p@@ ushed the Tur@@ ks and their German al@@ lies out of Palest@@ ine and Sy@@ ri@@ a. 
And there was bad news for Hy@@ der@@ p@@ ash@@ a st@@ ation too. 
In 19@@ 17 an am@@ mun@@ ition train ble@@ w up destro@@ ying its el@@ abor@@ ate ro@@ of@@ . 
Turk@@ ish sources say it was s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age. 
Since then it has slowly m@@ oul@@ dered a@@ way, largely by@@ passed by histor@@ y. 
But today, this rail@@ way g@@ ate@@ way to An@@ at@@ ol@@ ia and all points e@@ ast@@ , serv@@ es - symbol@@ ically at least - to high@@ light Turk@@ ey@@ 's wid@@ ening dipl@@ om@@ atic horiz@@ ons. 
The governing J@@ us@@ tice and Development party - the A@@ K@@ P - has cr@@ af@@ ted a whole new foreign policy for the country. 
The relative isol@@ ation from its surrounding region, en@@ gen@@ dered by the frozen b@@ ound@@ aries of the C@@ old W@@ ar, has g@@ one. 
Now there is a new policy of eng@@ ag@@ ement. 
Rem@@ ark@@ ably the Turk@@ ish government has good relations with Israel and Sy@@ ria, with the Palestinian fac@@ tions of Ham@@ as and F@@ at@@ a@@ h, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States. 
To g@@ au@@ ge the parameters of this new foreign polic@@ y, I boar@@ ded the night sleep@@ er to the Turk@@ ish capital An@@ k@@ ar@@ a, to visit one of the A@@ K@@ P@@ 's leading foreign policy exper@@ ts, Turk@@ ish MP Su@@ at K@@ ini@@ k@@ li@@ og@@ lu@@ . 
The next morning - some ten and a half hours later - after a j@@ ol@@ ting ride along trac@@ ks that produced the old world cad@@ ences of the famous document@@ ary The N@@ ight M@@ ail@@ , I arri@@ ved in the Turk@@ ish capital - proposed as a new city for a new sec@@ ular state int@@ ent on turning its back on the O@@ t@@ tom@@ an past. 
But the A@@ K@@ P with its well-known Islam@@ ist ro@@ ots represents a par@@ adi@@ g@@ m shift in the Turk@@ ish consen@@ sus@@ . 
It has promp@@ ted some suspic@@ ion in the West@@ , most notably in W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton. 
A tax@@ i took me to the A@@ K@@ P@@ 's head@@ qu@@ arter@@ s, an ul@@ tra-@@ modern stone and steel structure - purpos@@ e-@@ built - in a developing sub@@ ur@@ b, surroun@@ ded by half-@@ construc@@ ted shop@@ ping centres and power@@ -@@ pati@@ s@@ series where middle manag@@ ers in business su@@ its - both men and women - met to make early morning de@@ als. 
Su@@ at K@@ ini@@ k@@ li@@ og@@ l@@ u could have been a cent@@ re-@@ right politic@@ ian from almost any other political party in Europe. 
Su@@ it, ti@@ e, I am sure he was even pac@@ king a Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ r@@ y. 
"@@ The aim of the par@@ ty@@ 's foreign policy is now to re-@@ integr@@ ate Turkey into its immediate neighbour@@ hood. 
The C@@ old W@@ ar was an an@@ om@@ aly@@ ,@@ " he told me. 
Turkey had been cut off from its h@@ inter@@ land. 
To@@ day it had to look e@@ ast@@ wards and we@@ st@@ wards at the same time. 
It was not a case of one or the other. 
It had to do bo@@ th. 
"@@ But su@@ rely at some point@@ ,@@ " I ask@@ ed, "@@ Turkey might be forced to cho@@ os@@ e@@ ?@@ " 
"@@ Turk@@ ey@@ ,@@ " he said, "@@ did not want to have to face that cho@@ ic@@ e.@@ " 
He then stres@@ sed a point that almost everyone I have spok@@ en to here has rec@@ ited almost by ro@@ te@@ : Turk@@ ey@@ 's ties not just to the Mid@@ dle E@@ ast@@ , but to the Caucas@@ us, and around the B@@ lack Se@@ a, are as much to the benefit of Europe and the United States as they are to Tur@@ ke@@ y. 
With Turkey on boar@@ d, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically ride those rail lines e@@ ast@@ wards towards Asi@@ a and the Mid@@ dle E@@ ast@@ . 
B@@ ack at Hy@@ dar@@ p@@ ash@@ a st@@ ation, after another largely sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess night, I thought of those two German gentle@@ men Her@@ r Rit@@ ter and Her@@ r Con@@ u who had wat@@ ched this edi@@ f@@ ice being built 100 years ago. 
How surpris@@ ed they would have been to find that Europe's Mid@@ dle E@@ astern ambi@@ tions may now, to a large part, be in Turk@@ ey@@ 's hand@@ s. 
And as I wa@@ ited at the terminal for the ferry to take me back across the B@@ osph@@ or@@ us, I rec@@ all@@ ed that in those days Turkey had always been called "@@ the sick man of Europe@@ .@@ " 
Then at least there did not seem to be much doubt as to which contin@@ ent should lay claim to this f@@ asc@@ in@@ ating country. 
Liv@@ es remembe@@ red@@ : Ver@@ non Hand@@ ley and Wil@@ li@@ am W@@ o@@ od@@ ru@@ ff

Sec@@ ond assa@@ ul@@ t for H@@ on@@ da@@ 's super@@ -@@ selling 
N@@ ext November H@@ ond@@ a will laun@@ ch the marketing of the second J@@ az@@ z model gener@@ ation. 
If the previous model was already character@@ ized by high habit@@ ability, this new min@@ iv@@ an has an inter@@ ior wid@@ er spac@@ e. 
In addition, it is equipped with a fine mechan@@ ics which increases the driving comfor@@ t and per@@ mits to save fu@@ el. 
E@@ vol@@ ution instead of revolu@@ tion. 
This is H@@ ond@@ a J@@ az@@ z@@ ' second gener@@ ation. 
While aes@@ the@@ tically the new J@@ az@@ z looks like the previous mod@@ el, changes brought to the min@@ iv@@ an are numer@@ ous. 
Among others, it is worth pointing out its innovative design@@ , new plat@@ form, big@@ ger size and pre@@ t@@ ty new mechan@@ ics. 
Any@@ way, before moving on to analy@@ ze the new mod@@ el, may be useful to point out that this new J@@ az@@ z comes only six years after the entry of the first gener@@ ation. 
Therefore, a first observation should consider that H@@ ond@@ a has renew@@ ed this model more quickly than the other companies usually do. 
Even if the J@@ az@@ z model is less known in Europe than in other market@@ s, it remains a phenomen@@ on in terms of sal@@ es. 
This is the case of Jap@@ an, where J@@ az@@ z was the be@@ st-@@ selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008. 
Just there, almost a million units of J@@ az@@ z were sold from the mod@@ el@@ 's laun@@ ch. 
The second market was the O@@ ld Con@@ tin@@ ent, with about half a million units sold in six years. 
Despite these numb@@ ers, H@@ ond@@ a believ@@ es this new J@@ az@@ z will increase even more its sales in the seg@@ ment. 
So, if in 2007 the Jap@@ anese company sold a total of 8@@ 3@@ ,000 units of this mod@@ el, in 200@@ 9 it estimates it will be around 100@@ ,000 car@@ s. This fore@@ see a possible increase in sales of 17% just in the European market. 
Reg@@ ar@@ ding the Spanish market, H@@ ond@@ a has sold a total of 8@@ ,000 units of J@@ az@@ z since 2002, corresponding to 6.@@ 7% of total sales for the company in Spain. 
With the new gener@@ ation@@ 's com@@ ing, the responsible for the company in Spain expect to sell around 2.@@ 000 units of J@@ az@@ z within one year. 
The arri@@ val of the new H@@ ond@@ a J@@ az@@ z will probably make it possible, by reducing the lowering of sales in Spain to a large ext@@ ent. 
In fact, the persons in charge for the brand expect to get to the end of the year with a total of 22@@ ,000 units sol@@ d, that is 4.@@ 000 units less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16@@ %. 
Despite the increase in sal@@ es, H@@ ond@@ a has also incre@@ ment@@ ed its market share in Spain, reaching the 1.@@ 8@@ %, compared to the last year 1.@@ 6@@ %. 
At the same time, the Jap@@ anese company expec@@ ts to reach the 2% in 20@@ 10. 
To achieve this, H@@ ond@@ a is confid@@ ent in another new model of its. 
This is In@@ sigh@@ t, a hy@@ bri@@ d fiv@@ e-@@ door comp@@ act car@@ , 4.@@ 37 me@@ ters in leng@@ th. The Jap@@ anese company hop@@ es to sell about 200@@ ,000 units of this model world@@ w@@ ide, within one year. 
According to the markets and Jap@@ anese manufacturer@@ s' estim@@ ates, the 50% of In@@ sigh@@ t's sale will come from the United States, while the remaining 50% will be from both the O@@ ld Con@@ tin@@ ent and Jap@@ an. 
The commercial laun@@ ch of In@@ sight is planned for the early next year, shor@@ tly after the presentation of the model inside the company in January in Val@@ enz@@ a. 
Compared to the first gener@@ ation, the new J@@ az@@ z has gro@@ wn in all its enti@@ ret@@ y. 
It reaches now 3@@ ,@@ 90 me@@ ters length (@@ five c@@ enti@@ metres more@@ ), 1,@@ 69 me@@ ters wid@@ th (@@ two c@@ enti@@ metres more@@ ) and its inter@@ ax@@ le 2,@@ 50 me@@ ters, with an incre@@ ment of five c@@ enti@@ me@@ tre@@ s. 
Its 1,@@ 52 me@@ ters he@@ igh@@ t, stil@@ l, remained un@@ changed. 
T@@ og@@ ether with the siz@@ e, its hab@@ itable inter@@ ior increased in spac@@ e. 
This advantage stem@@ s, first of all from the new plat@@ form, and second from the introduction of the fuel tan@@ k in a central loc@@ ation, a solution already adopted in the previous J@@ az@@ z@@ . 
Moreover, the tr@@ un@@ k@@ 's capacity - a double bottom volume - rises to 39@@ 9 lit@@ res, a 19 litres big@@ ger capacity respect to the first gener@@ ation. 
To be no@@ ted, these is the H@@ ond@@ a J@@ az@@ z 1.@@ 4@@ 's measures, while the tr@@ un@@ k@@ 's capacity in model 1.@@ 2 is just 37@@ 9 lit@@ res. 
Other improvements - in addition to external el@@ ements, such as the re@@ ar led or the possibility to m@@ ount the pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic glass - concern the improved access to back se@@ at@@ s. 
Do@@ ors which allow access to back se@@ ats, open now with an ang@@ le of 80 degre@@ es, compared to 67 degrees in the first mod@@ el. 
In addition, all eng@@ ines are pre@@ t@@ ty new in this second generation of car@@ s. 
At the time of market@@ ing, this small model will come with a petro@@ l eng@@ ines of 1.@@ 2 or 1.4 lit@@ res. 
Both mechanical systems will include the i@@ -@@ V@@ TE@@ C technology which per@@ mits a lower fuel consump@@ tion, produces less carbon dioxide emis@@ sions, optim@@ iz@@ es the mechanical refin@@ ements and, at the same time, maintain@@ s high tor@@ que eng@@ ine in all its phas@@ es. 
The 1.@@ 2 litre version reaches a power of 90 h@@ p at 6@@ 000 r@@ p@@ m with a maximum tor@@ que of 1@@ 14 N@@ m. at 4@@ 900 r@@ p@@ m. 
The pro@@ pul@@ sion - which in previous J@@ az@@ z reached the 7@@ 8 h@@ p – just needs 5.@@ 3 litres of fuel and produces around 1@@ 25 grams of CO2 emissions equival@@ ent. 
Compared to the previous pro@@ pul@@ sion, which in the first-@@ generation model used 83 h@@ p, the new one can take advantage of 100 h@@ p. 
The 1.4 J@@ az@@ z with 100 h@@ p reaches a combination of 5.@@ 4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 em@@ it@@ ted. 
A '@@ be@@ e-@@ car@@ ' to avoid coll@@ is@@ ions 
In developing the technologies for the prevention of accid@@ ents, N@@ is@@ s@@ an got in@@ sp@@ ired this time, by nat@@ ure, and especially by be@@ es. 
The Jap@@ anese company has created a ro@@ bo@@ t that, imit@@ ating the flight of be@@ es, can avoid accid@@ ents. 
This is the Bi@@ o-@@ mi@@ me@@ tic C@@ ar Rob@@ ot D@@ ri@@ ve, or BR@@ 23@@ C, the first step to project technologies for the prevention of coll@@ is@@ ions. 
The engine@@ ers of the Ad@@ v@@ anced Technical Centre of N@@ is@@ s@@ an M@@ otor Co@@ . have developed this little ro@@ bo@@ t in collabor@@ ation with the Centre for Scientific Research and Technolog@@ y of the pres@@ ti@@ gious University of T@@ ok@@ y@@ o in Jap@@ an. 
According to K@@ az@@ u@@ h@@ iro Do@@ i, general director of Public Rel@@ ations for the Technolog@@ y, Research and Development of Br@@ and Man@@ ag@@ ement, the BR@@ 23@@ C is an expan@@ sion of the Security S@@ hi@@ el@@ d of the four areas produced by N@@ is@@ s@@ an. 
This ro@@ bo@@ t is intended to improve the ability to prevent coll@@ is@@ ions in the vehicles produced by the compan@@ y. 
During the f@@ light, each be@@ e cre@@ ates its own ov@@ al personal space that is very similar to the S@@ hi@@ el@@ d of Security developed by N@@ is@@ s@@ an. 
But the most important element is con@@ stituted by the be@@ e's compound eyes, which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees ang@@ le, allowing the insec@@ t to f@@ ly with no interruption inside its personal spac@@ e. 
To rec@@ re@@ ate these visual feat@@ ures, engine@@ ers developed what they defined a las@@ er loc@@ ator (L@@ as@@ er R@@ ange Fin@@ der@@ ). 
This mechanism detec@@ ts obstac@@ les within 2 me@@ ters and a radi@@ us up to 180 degrees in front of the BR@@ 23@@ C, calcul@@ ates the distance to the objec@@ t and s@@ ends a signal to the micro@@ process@@ or on board that immediately allows preventing the coll@@ is@@ ion. 
"@@ When detec@@ ts an obstac@@ le, the little ro@@ bo@@ t imit@@ ates the be@@ e's movements and change direction immediately by turning the whe@@ els at a right or wid@@ er ang@@ le to avoid the coll@@ is@@ ion. 
The most evident difference with any existing system is its ev@@ as@@ ive action which results to be totally inst@@ inc@@ tive. 
"@@ If it were not so, the ro@@ bo@@ t would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstac@@ les@@ " explains T@@ os@@ hi@@ y@@ uk@@ i An@@ do@@ h, director of the Laboratory of M@@ ob@@ ility and ch@@ ie@@ f engine@@ er of this projec@@ t. 
Un@@ like a be@@ e, the ro@@ bo@@ t can not de@@ vi@@ ate up@@ wards or down@@ war@@ ds, or even diag@@ on@@ ally. It can only move in two dimen@@ sions and in the direction its whe@@ els can turn to. Ob@@ vi@@ ously, it cannot run inf@@ in@@ ite directions and ways like be@@ es do. 
For this reason, N@@ is@@ s@@ an has used a ro@@ tation function in addition to the accel@@ eration and dec@@ el@@ eration func@@ tions, to permit the little ro@@ bo@@ t can avoid coll@@ is@@ ions. 
"@@ This device only needs to process new information every few second@@ s, and acting from this data. 
It does not require to store any information or to use the in@@ tu@@ itive logic of prior man@@ eu@@ ver@@ s. For this reason it can go without interruption supplied only by a few doz@@ en K@@ B of memor@@ y. 
This may surpris@@ e, but we are not talking of g@@ ig@@ ab@@ yt@@ es or me@@ g@@ a of memor@@ y@@ .@@ " 
This is the first step to@@ ward developing new technologies for the prevention of coll@@ is@@ ions, a technology N@@ is@@ s@@ an hop@@ es will be introduced in cars as standard fe@@ ature within ten years. 
The ro@@ bo@@ t uses lithi@@ um-@@ poly@@ mer batter@@ ies, which are ligh@@ ter and more durable than the lithi@@ um-@@ ion ty@@ pol@@ og@@ y. 
An additional application in a potential future could be the integration of this technology with the G@@ P@@ S sat@@ ellite n@@ avi@@ g@@ ator to bring the driver to a specific destin@@ ation, avoid@@ ing obstac@@ les along the path@@ . 
Do sh@@ ud@@ der before applying for a lo@@ an 
We have to recogn@@ ize that the Department of T@@ reas@@ ury of the United States, own@@ ing quite good capit@@ als to act, certainly does not lack of tal@@ ent. 
Having to face the crisis and to prevent the Americ@@ ans to be che@@ ated with gar@@ b@@ age lo@@ ans by banks under doub@@ ts of in@@ solv@@ ency, created a fu@@ n and educational game for Internet us@@ ers. This is "@@ B@@ ad C@@ redi@@ t H@@ ot@@ el@@ ". 
In other words, the "@@ H@@ ot@@ el of the bad cred@@ it@@ s@@ "@@ ... or of the problems. 
The glo@@ om aspect of this hotel and, in particular, of its rec@@ ep@@ tion@@ ist aims to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times before applying for a lo@@ an. 
And above all, to think quite carefully about where applying for it. This is probably the game primary objec@@ tive. 
Cer@@ tain@@ ly this system provides several useful information, but offers rather few detail@@ s. 
I@@ t's much more a web page for te@@ ens than a site for the general public.

M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley opened its capital to M@@ UF@@ G 
M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley has announc@@ ed its entry to the table round of Mit@@ sub@@ ish@@ i UF@@ J Financial Group (M@@ UF@@ G@@ ), the first bank of Jap@@ an, who will spend nine billion dol@@ lar@@ s to obtain 2@@ 1% of its capit@@ al, news that has been received by a shar@@ p drop in share prices. 
A week after un@@ ve@@ iling a provis@@ ional agre@@ ement, the two banks have expl@@ ained that M@@ UF@@ G would buy 9.@@ 9% of M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley sha@@ res at a price of 2@@ 5.@@ 25 dol@@ lar@@ s, tot@@ alling three billion dol@@ lar@@ s.

M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley aff@@ ir@@ med that the overall operation would be based on an average unit price of 29 dol@@ lar@@ s, or 28@@ % above its current pr@@ ice.

"@@ This strategic alli@@ ance con@@ stit@@ utes an important opportunity to accel@@ er@@ ate the transition of M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley to the status of holding bank@@ ,@@ " said Joh@@ n M@@ ack@@ , the CE@@ O of the American group. 
M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley has adopted this new status last week, which should enable it to diver@@ si@@ fy its activities but it has to pass through the authority of the Fed@@ eral Res@@ er@@ ve. 
Its alli@@ ance with M@@ UF@@ G also confir@@ ms that the current financial crisis forced the big@@ gest names on W@@ all Street to adopt a much more cau@@ tious attitude than before. 
The mod@@ alities presented on Mon@@ day show that the agreement has been amended in recent days@@ : the previous Mon@@ day, M@@ organ had just announc@@ ed it would sell up to 20% of its sha@@ res to the Jap@@ anese for about $ 8.@@ 5 billi@@ on. 
"@@ A week ago, expl@@ ained T@@ os@@ hi@@ h@@ ide M@@ iz@@ u@@ no@@ , execu@@ tive director of M@@ UF@@ G in T@@ ok@@ y@@ o@@ ,@@ " we thought that the particip@@ ation would be entirely composed of ordinary sha@@ res. 
But given the current state of the economy and market, we hop@@ ed to minim@@ ize the risks and to protect our back@@ s.@@ " 
Based on the weigh@@ ted average price M@@ UF@@ G will pay for its M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley sec@@ uri@@ ties 7% below their book valu@@ e. 
And the trans@@ action will result in a dil@@ ution of around 20% ear@@ n@@ ings per sha@@ re. 
The agreement forese@@ es that M@@ UF@@ G may conver@@ t ann@@ ually half of its preferred sec@@ uri@@ ties into ordinary sha@@ res if these trad@@ ed more than 50% above the conversion pr@@ ice, about $ 47 for a given period. 
M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley assu@@ res that the capital provided by M@@ UF@@ G will enable it to seiz@@ e investment opportun@@ ities, streng@@ then its balance she@@ et and increase its liqu@@ id@@ ity. 
a spok@@ es@@ person for the group, however, ref@@ used to give details on the strategic projects of the two new alli@@ es. 
After the investment of M@@ UF@@ G, M@@ organ St@@ an@@ ley forecast@@ s a capital ratio T@@ ier One of about 15@@ %, one of the best in the industry. 
M@@ organ said to have "@@ signific@@ ant@@ ly@@ " reduced its balance she@@ et since the end of Aug@@ ust@@ . 
Rec@@ ent weeks have been difficult for the group, which saw half its share price mel@@ t away while the in@@ surance costs against the risk of de@@ faul@@ t on its debt so@@ are@@ d. 
This cost reduced on Mon@@ day but remained at a new high level, around 12@@ %. 
Last week, G@@ old@@ man S@@ ach@@ s, the only other survi@@ ving major investment bank on W@@ all Street after the bank@@ rup@@ t@@ c@@ y of Be@@ ar Ste@@ ar@@ ns and Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers and Mer@@ r@@ ill L@@ yn@@ ch acqu@@ is@@ i@@ tion, announc@@ ed it had raised $ 15 billi@@ on, par@@ tly from Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ a@@ way, the group of War@@ ren B@@ uff@@ et@@ t.

This is the joint project of the Ven@@ ez@@ u@@ el@@ an Hu@@ go Ch@@ á@@ ve@@ z, E@@ vo Mor@@ ales of Bol@@ ivi@@ a, and the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or@@ ian R@@ af@@ a@@ el Cor@@ re@@ a. 
This S@@ un@@ day, like its counter@@ parts and friend@@ s, it is the third to put to a vote a draft for a new constitu@@ tion. 
Mis@@ sion ac@@ compl@@ ished since 6@@ 4% of voters voted "@@ y@@ es@@ " to referendu@@ m, according to official results based on 80% of the vot@@ es. 
Based on these results, the "@@ no@@ " got 28@@ %, 7% of the votes were inv@@ al@@ id, and 0.@@ 7% were bl@@ an@@ k vot@@ es. 
For the draft Con@@ stitution to be adop@@ ted, it should get half the votes plus one. 
S@@ un@@ day, two poll@@ s conducted outside the pol@@ ling stations and one non-@@ governmental organ@@ ization had announc@@ ed a large vic@@ tory for the "@@ y@@ es@@ "@@ , of the range between 6@@ 3% and 70@@ %. 
R@@ af@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea had claimed during the night from S@@ un@@ day to Mon@@ day the vic@@ tory of his draft constitu@@ tion. 
The "@@ Con@@ stitution has trium@@ ph@@ ed so over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing@@ ly@@ ,@@ " he assu@@ red, comm@@ ending the E@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ ans in the government head@@ quarters in Gu@@ ay@@ aqu@@ il, 28@@ 0 km sou@@ th@@ west of Qu@@ it@@ o. 
As of course, R@@ af@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea was con@@ gr@@ atul@@ ated by Cha@@ ve@@ z and Mor@@ ales but also by his Ch@@ ile@@ an counter@@ part Mic@@ hel@@ le B@@ ach@@ el@@ et. 
The poll@@ , which was conducted peac@@ eful@@ ly under the scrutin@@ y of the Organ@@ ization of American States (O@@ AS@@ ), covered in its text 4@@ 44 points which consolid@@ ate the "@@ new soci@@ al@@ ism@@ " adv@@ oc@@ ated by the presid@@ ent. 
The draft con@@ stitution en@@ sh@@ r@@ ines the power of the state over the econom@@ y, by reserv@@ ing it the "@@ development pl@@ ann@@ ing@@ " of a country living mainly from the extrac@@ tion of oil by foreign companies and the foreign money that they send to their em@@ ig@@ r@@ ants. 
Bu@@ o@@ yed by Cor@@ re@@ a, elected in 200@@ 6, the project also provides greater powers to the Head of St@@ ate, which can carry up to two consecutive terms of four years and will be able to dissol@@ ve the As@@ se@@ mb@@ ly. 
Cor@@ rea has already announc@@ ed that he would use that power to seek a new mandate in February 200@@ 9. 
The Con@@ stitution also consolid@@ ates the principle of free health services and education that the presid@@ ent has begun to establish in this country of 13.@@ 9 million inhabit@@ ants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line. 
It also forese@@ es the pro@@ hibition of the presence of foreign tro@@ op@@ s, which will termin@@ ate the agreement between Qu@@ it@@ o and W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton for using E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or as a laun@@ ch base for U@@ .@@ S. anti@@ drug oper@@ ations.

An Egyp@@ ti@@ an security official said that 30 members of the special forc@@ es, carried ab@@ o@@ ard two hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters, had launched the assa@@ ul@@ t during the night just before da@@ wn. 
"@@ A fire exchange ensu@@ ed, and half of the kid@@ n@@ ap@@ pers were kil@@ led, the other half fle@@ d@@ "@@ , said the official who requested an@@ on@@ y@@ mit@@ y. 
He said that 150 members of the Egyp@@ ti@@ an special forces "@@ rapid response@@ " unit have been sent to Sud@@ an as a whole, where they received support from German and Italian comm@@ and@@ os. 
The head of the Italian dipl@@ om@@ atic cor@@ ps Franc@@ o Fr@@ att@@ ini in Bel@@ grade where he currently is, mentioned the role played by Italian secret agents and elements of the special forc@@ es. 
"@@ We must recogn@@ ize that we have achieved this result through the profession@@ alism and effectiveness of our men from the secret servic@@ es, from the special forc@@ es@@ ,@@ " he said, without further detail@@ s.

For@@ tis bank partially nation@@ alized by Ben@@ el@@ ux govern@@ ments 
Ben@@ el@@ ux states help For@@ tis, the Belgi@@ an-@@ Dutch bank - which is the first European financial in@@ stitute in trouble due to the follow-@@ through effect of the American l@@ ending crisis - by a partial state bu@@ you@@ t. The three countries have agreed to inject EUR 11.@@ 2 billion into the ban@@ king and in@@ surance company having Hungarian interest@@ s. 
At the end of this week, the Belgi@@ an, the Luxembourg and the Dutch govern@@ ments consul@@ ted on this issue at the highest level, involving the President of the European Cent@@ ral Ban@@ k and the Com@@ peti@@ tion Commissioner of the European Commission. 
Within the E@@ uro z@@ one, For@@ tis is the first bank h@@ it by the international financial crisis approach@@ ing in wav@@ es in the last 12 months. Thus, from a certain point of view, the decisions made may be considered preced@@ ent. 
Under the decision made on S@@ un@@ day night, each government will take a 49 percent st@@ ake in For@@ tis banks in their respective countries. 
The bank will certainly sell some part of its stak@@ es, especially the in@@ surance activi@@ ties, which it purch@@ ased from the Dutch AB@@ N Am@@ ro last year. 
For@@ tis sha@@ res started to plung@@ e deeply last week, then in the second part of the week signs of a serious crisis appeared at the compan@@ y. 
An@@ aly@@ sts agree that the bank - with its 85 000 employees - is too big to be allowed to go bank@@ rup@@ t. 
The sha@@ res of the bank fell by 12% on Fri@@ day, which is the record lowest level for 14 years. 
The value of the sha@@ res has been dropped by two thir@@ ds since Janu@@ ary. 
Consi@@ dering the current stock pric@@ es, the entire market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billi@@ on. However, company direc@@ tors say this does not reflect re@@ ality. 
The management b@@ lam@@ es the uncertain@@ ties over@@ se@@ as - which are linked to accep@@ ting the American package of USD 700 billion - for the fall of For@@ tis sha@@ res. 
The stocks showed a slight rise on Mon@@ day. 
F@@ ili@@ p Di@@ erc@@ k@@ x was appointed the new ch@@ ie@@ f execu@@ tive offic@@ er of the bank on Fri@@ day. 
The financial in@@ stitute was also see@@ king private bu@@ y@@ ers but no subst@@ an@@ tive offer has been made so far@@ . 
The Belgian government declared earlier that the invest@@ ors had no reason to wor@@ ry, they would not lose their money. 
No pan@@ ic has emerg@@ ed so far among the custom@@ ers of the bank@@ ; no bank r@@ ush has taken place. 
For@@ tis has an own ban@@ king establishment in Hungary and has bought out le@@ as@@ ing companies, too. 
Fo@@ x In The H@@ en@@ house 
The American life and health in@@ surance companies often ref@@ use to sell in@@ surance to some citizen@@ s, due to their drug purch@@ ase data. 
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market becomes un@@ control@@ lab@@ le. 
"@@ There is a data protection programme that requires the per@@ mission of the person concerned in order to use the drug prescription data. 
It should be independ@@ ent, otherwise the fo@@ x will be guar@@ ding the h@@ en@@ -@@ house@@ "@@ , The W@@ ash@@ ing@@ ton Post quot@@ es R@@ ic@@ hard D@@ ick@@ , develop@@ er of the programme applicable for trac@@ king drug prescrip@@ tions. 
In@@ surance companies decide on the in@@ surance fe@@ e and the amount to be paid in case of dam@@ ages depending on the health condition of the applying custom@@ er, and if they consider it too risk@@ y, they do not provide in@@ sur@@ ance. 
The applying custom@@ ers used to be sent to have a medical examination performed, and the contract was concluded in light of the screening results only. 
D@@ ick developed a much cheap@@ er method ten years ag@@ o@@ : on the basis of the custom@@ er's identification number the type of drugs purch@@ ased by the custom@@ er in the last 18 months can be easily detec@@ ted, thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condi@@ tion. 
For instance, the case of regularly bu@@ ying big doses of cholesterol@@ -@@ reducing drugs prac@@ tically refers to the fact that the custom@@ er has un@@ treat@@ ably high blood fat level, as a result of which this person would immediately be put to a higher risk categor@@ y. 
The programme has various versions in tra@@ de, some of them even defin@@ es the risk fact@@ or, thus the in@@ surance company has nothing else to do but the pap@@ er@@ work, though smaller difficulties aris@@ e. 
One of the dis@@ advantages is the fact that some drugs can be used for several purposes, for example some medical formula are to treat mig@@ ra@@ ine, heat wav@@ es or even depres@@ sion. 
The latter one is a significant risk-@@ increasing factor from the view of business in@@ su@@ rer@@ s, while the other two are not. 
There are specific companies dealing with obtaining and processing data, and they ask per@@ mission from the patient before acqu@@ iring the necessary information from the pharmac@@ ies. 
They are already oblig@@ ed to do so, though their previous fail@@ ures have not been pen@@ aliz@@ ed. 
Some companies process even the results of laboratory examinations and connec@@ t those to drug consumption data. This way they can provide more accurate information on the patient@@ s' health condi@@ tion. 
More and more companies gain access to the data and, in par@@ all@@ el, the control of their use become increasingly difficul@@ t. 
There is a specific act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care provi@@ ders and in@@ surance companies. 
The b@@ ill on providing inspection power for the authorities over companies dealing with data provision has been submitted to the Con@@ gres@@ s. 
D@@ ick R@@ ic@@ hard re@@ aliz@@ es that it is not enough@@ : that is why he has further developed his programme, which would now restrict data transfer in respect of requiring the expres@@ sed con@@ sent of the person concerned. 
It is another question, though, that the applicant cannot really ref@@ use cons@@ ent, otherwise the in@@ surance companies will not conclude contract with them. 
So h@@ en@@ s, to a certain degre@@ e, will continue to depend on the ben@@ evol@@ ence of the fo@@ x. 
Global Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le Men@@ u 
European Union and India Dou@@ bles Tr@@ ade 
As the European Union and India are leading trade partners of each other, the agenda of the n@@ inth summit was also domin@@ ated by this issue in addition to other, mainly glob@@ al, problems. 
To@@ day a Franc@@ e-@@ India Sum@@ mit is going to be hel@@ d, too, particularly about nuclear power co-@@ operation. 
Th@@ ough the European Union recogn@@ iz@@ es that India is an emerg@@ ing democratic worl@@ d-@@ pow@@ er, which should be granted more say in international affair@@ s, the member states have not been able to come to an agreement yet whether to support the permanent memb@@ ership of New Del@@ h@@ i in UN Security Council or not. 
Thus this matter was not forced during the n@@ inth summit@@ , organ@@ ized in Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le yester@@ day. 
French President Nic@@ ol@@ as S@@ ark@@ oz@@ y as R@@ ot@@ ating President of the Union, Committee President Jos@@ é Man@@ u@@ el Barro@@ so and F@@ ore@@ ign Pol@@ ic@@ y Chi@@ ef J@@ avi@@ er Sol@@ ana welcom@@ ed Indi@@ an Prime Minister Man@@ mo@@ h@@ an Sing@@ h and agreed to double@@ , i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euro@@ s, the trade flow in 5 years. 
Since exchange of goods raised from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an over@@ ly amb@@ iti@@ ous objec@@ tive. 
Accor@@ ding@@ ly, 26 existing bil@@ ateral civil avi@@ ation conven@@ tions with India have been legally harmon@@ iz@@ ed, meaning that air traffic can wing in the future. 
India aims to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 200@@ 9. 
S@@ ark@@ oz@@ y promis@@ ed to accel@@ er@@ ate harmon@@ iz@@ ing. 
The goal is to find the balance while India is number one trade part@@ ner of the EU, at the same time New Del@@ h@@ i has only the n@@ inth place on the list of EU part@@ n@@ ers. 
The summit concentr@@ ated on global issu@@ es: 
On the situation in Afghanist@@ an and Pakist@@ an as well as on terroris@@ m. The latter was condemned in every form by both parties and conven@@ ing the UN Conference was urg@@ ed. 
The comple@@ tion of Doh@@ a Tr@@ ade R@@ ound was also exp@@ ed@@ ited, although both parties are responsible for the fi@@ asc@@ o so far@@ . 
The EU confirmed to maintain its energy and climate programme, meaning to have the intention to cut air pollut@@ ants emission by at least 20 per cent until 20@@ 20. 
India agreed with this as well as with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate con@@ ference which is due next year and to decrease green@@ house gas emission by 50 percent until 20@@ 50. 
Another goal was to prevent the growth of food prices and a call for an international con@@ ference to review financial crisis was support@@ ed. 
The Indi@@ an Prime Minister is going to a bil@@ ateral meeting in the French capital today, where he int@@ ends to come to an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear pow@@ er. 
Par@@ is expec@@ ts French companies to be a@@ war@@ ded contracts to build nuclear react@@ ors in India in a value of 20 billion euro@@ s. 
According to news agency information, the agreement would be in force for 15 years.

F@@ ound the aeroplan@@ e of Ste@@ ve Fos@@ set@@ t the milli@@ on@@ a@@ ire dis@@ appeared a year ago 
The wrec@@ k of the aeroplan@@ e of Ste@@ ve Fos@@ set@@ t, the milli@@ on@@ a@@ ire who dis@@ appeared on the 3@@ r@@ d September 2007 while fl@@ ying over the N@@ ev@@ ada deser@@ t, has been foun@@ d. 
The wrec@@ k@@ age has been found on a pl@@ ate@@ au at 3000 metres al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de, in the Si@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ada area of M@@ am@@ mot@@ h L@@ ak@@ es, at the border between Cal@@ i@@ for@@ nia and N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a. 
In@@ side the air@@ plan@@ e, however, there were no human remain@@ s. 
The Mad@@ era Coun@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff@@ , Joh@@ n An@@ der@@ s@@ on, has disp@@ elled any remaining doub@@ ts: "@@ The aeroplan@@ e has been loc@@ ated, we have sent a te@@ am, and now we have confir@@ mation that it is the one on which Ste@@ ve Fol@@ let@@ t was fl@@ ying the day he dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d@@ " he said in a press con@@ ferenc@@ e. 
Af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds, the sh@@ er@@ iff pointed out that no human remains have been found either on the plan@@ e, nor in the surrounding area. 
The milli@@ on@@ ai@@ re, 63 years old, was given up for dead in Febru@@ ary. 
The American National Tran@@ sport Safety B@@ ure@@ au (N@@ T@@ S@@ B) has reported that some hours after the wrec@@ k was spot@@ ted an investig@@ atory team was s@@ ent, that has then identified the aircraf@@ t: it is the B@@ ell@@ anc@@ a 8@@ K@@ C@@ AB, which has been missing since 3@@ r@@ d September 2007, when Fos@@ set@@ t took off from Y@@ er@@ ing@@ ton in N@@ ev@@ ada for a three hour f@@ light. 
Y@@ ester@@ day, always in Cal@@ i@@ for@@ nia, not far from the border with N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a, some personal effects belonging to Fos@@ set@@ t were found by a couple near their house in M@@ am@@ mot@@ h L@@ ak@@ es. 
The items are two documents in the name of Fos@@ set@@ t, both issued by the Fed@@ eral Avi@@ ation Administration of Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is, some cas@@ h, and a swe@@ at@@ shir@@ t. 
The search for Fos@@ set@@ t was called off a month after he had dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d. 
The milli@@ on@@ a@@ ire had gained himself a place in history thanks to a series of world record@@ s. 
In 2002, at his six@@ th attemp@@ t, he became the first man to complete the round the world tri@@ p in a hot air bal@@ lo@@ on@@ : a two-@@ week sol@@ o f@@ light. 
Three years later he did the round the world tri@@ p by pl@@ ane without land@@ ing. 
Among his many record@@ s, there is also fl@@ ying at 15@@ ,@@ 4@@ 45 me@@ tre@@ s, above the And@@ es, but with a co-@@ pil@@ ot@@ . 
Gl@@ k, the advertising that does not awa@@ it you 
An SU@@ V which is outside the norm@@ s with an original design defined by decis@@ ive lin@@ es, am@@ ple surfac@@ es and clean cut cor@@ n@@ ers. 
In shor@@ t, this is GL@@ K@@ , the latest addition to the "@@ comp@@ act@@ " off-@@ road vehicles from the star@@ red manufacturer@@ , with which Merc@@ ed@@ es-@@ Ben@@ z has tried to let in a breath of fresh air into this sector. 
R@@ ight because its features are out of the traditional norm@@ s, the message accompanying the laun@@ ch of the GL@@ K SU@@ V will also be un@@ expected and un@@ conven@@ tion@@ al, it will be available in Merc@@ ed@@ es-@@ Ben@@ z show@@ rooms as from next October 17@@ th. 
So the public@@ ity campa@@ ign that will ac@@ company the de@@ but of the new vehicle will set off a new communication method which also includes a fut@@ ur@@ istic campa@@ ign of 3@@ D b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ard@@ s, used for the first time in Italy by a car br@@ and. 
A project of large b@@ ill@@ bo@@ ard@@ s, set in motion in three different phas@@ es, which will domin@@ ate the most central Mil@@ anese shop@@ ping stre@@ et, Cor@@ so Com@@ o, until the 15@@ th Nov@@ emb@@ er. 
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with a presentation of the car in ste@@ re@@ os@@ cop@@ ic vision, and thanks to special gl@@ asses distributed in the neighbour@@ hood of Cor@@ so Com@@ o it will be possible to see the new SU@@ V in true size and 3@@ D form@@ at. 
In fact, looking at the image one will get the sensation that the car pro@@ tr@@ ud@@ es out of the po@@ ster@@ . 
Subsequ@@ ently, through the use of the innovative technology El@@ um@@ ina 8 all the details of the new GL@@ K will be ill@@ um@@ inated at various times, and then be re@@ composed as a single im@@ age. 
Without any doub@@ ts, Merc@@ ed@@ es, through this adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment, is trying to introduce something new into the conventional field of autom@@ o@@ tive public@@ ity. 
Will it succe@@ ed with this formula to pro@@ vo@@ ke the interest of future bu@@ y@@ ers? We will se@@ e.

And the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior at V@@ imin@@ ale had in fact checked them all@@ : among those groups going to S@@ of@@ ia none was bann@@ ed, none had been for@@ bid@@ den to frequent a st@@ adi@@ um. 
Four Italian suppor@@ ters, who had previous st@@ adi@@ um-@@ related crim@@ es, had in fact been ref@@ used tic@@ kets and kept from go@@ ing. 
Now the Ministry of the Inter@@ ior is waiting to be able to read the official record@@ s, which should arrive from the Bulg@@ arian police before taking step@@ s: in this instance, it is possible to ban for five years at least the suppor@@ ters that have been arrested or those that have been identified during the disturb@@ ances. 
An international ban@@ ish@@ ment which prohib@@ its the att@@ end@@ ance of not only st@@ adi@@ ums in Italy but also in all of Europe. 
Our ho@@ olig@@ ans, in shor@@ t, would not enter another st@@ adi@@ um. 
F@@ ort@@ un@@ ately. 
But now there is fear of emul@@ ation: that is that others jo@@ in to that little more than one hundred and fif@@ ty. 
"@@ We have to immediately put out this con@@ flag@@ ration and not legitim@@ ise those that be@@ have in this fas@@ hi@@ on@@ "@@ , as@@ sert those at the Ministry in V@@ imin@@ al@@ e. 
So, "@@ eyes wide open especially since there is the National team playing on Wednes@@ day at L@@ ec@@ ce@@ ". 
In P@@ ug@@ li@@ a in fact there is a small nucle@@ us of Ultr@@ as Italia suppor@@ ters. 
T@@ om@@ or@@ row the Ob@@ serv@@ atory meet@@ s, on Tues@@ day the C@@ AS@@ MS which can count on a section of the AI@@ SE@@ , that is the secret serv@@ ice, which hand@@ les exactly the problems in st@@ adi@@ um@@ s. 
"@@ The ch@@ or@@ us D@@ uc@@ e-@@ Du@@ ce and the arm stret@@ ched out during the M@@ am@@ el@@ i an@@ them? In Bulg@@ aria it's not a cri@@ me@@ ..@@ .@@ ". 
These are the thoughts (@@ expres@@ sed with great disappoint@@ ment@@ ) of D@@ omen@@ ic@@ o M@@ az@@ z@@ il@@ li@@ , who, as of a few weeks ago, is the director of the Ob@@ serv@@ atory of the V@@ imin@@ ale (@@ he achieved the post which was initially held by Franc@@ esc@@ o T@@ ag@@ li@@ ent@@ e and then by F@@ el@@ ice Fer@@ li@@ zz@@ i@@ ). 
Pre@@ vi@@ ously, M@@ az@@ z@@ ill@@ i had been head of the police administration in Tri@@ est@@ e where there is a nucle@@ us of suppor@@ ters of Ultr@@ as Ital@@ ia, foun@@ ded in 2002. 
I@@ t's tru@@ e, says M@@ az@@ z@@ il@@ li@@ , that in Bulg@@ aria it is not a crime to ch@@ ant hy@@ m@@ ns to the Du@@ ce but certainly the behaviour of those 150@@ -2@@ 00 f@@ ans has been dis@@ grac@@ eful@@ . 
"@@ I am not a soci@@ ologist - ad@@ ds the n@@ .@@ 1 of the Ob@@ serv@@ atory – the crime should be imp@@ u@@ ted in the country where the incident occur@@ s. 
T@@ ill now this group has remained within the lin@@ es, now we will see what actually happened and we will evaluate it for future refe@@ renc@@ e. 
But let us also talk about the wh@@ ist@@ ling to the M@@ am@@ el@@ i an@@ them@@ : that is also not a crime in Bulg@@ aria, but, if I@@ '@@ m allowed to say, it is not good mann@@ ers ..@@ .@@ ".
